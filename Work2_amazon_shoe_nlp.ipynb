The outer sole is so thin that although I wear them almost completely in the house on rugs the inner padding is showing through in the heel. My previous pair from the same company lasted 5 years before I threw them out.  I'm sorry I didn't wear them more often when I first got them as I would have returned them immediately\n",

      "6 Ok, I have been searching for shoes to replace the shoes I used to wear but are now too crazy expensive. (wanna guess?) I am so happy with these, I did get them on sale, which helped me a lot, but honestly, these are truly worth more. The\\y are so comfortable, the arch is awesome, the cushioning, which is my number one issue (fat woman, 35 years working intensive care) is amazing. I love that the tongue is super thin and doesn't get in the way. I love the lacing system, but i needed a little more room in the shoe, some days it works great, other days i wish i just had one more inch, lol. Are you looking for an amazing shoe? Cushioning, smooth rocker bottom?? These are them, I couldn't be happier. I also introduced them to another friend who worked ICU with me for many years, she bought them and adores them too!!! (yes they are a little on the narrow side, just be aware)\n",
      "7 I went a full size down and they fit better but these are kinda wide.  Nonetheless I love them!\n",
      "8 I would have to say this is boot is very good for my line of work and I buy a pair every year.\n",
      "9 The size is misleading!\n",
      "10 These shoes are very comfortable.\n",
      "11 I love these sandals!\n",
      "12 Good quality shoes. Great for casual or business attire. Lots of compliments!\n",
      "13 My daughter really likes those shoes. They are comfortable and fit well.The black started to fade already after only a couple of weeks but they are still good shoes.\n",
      "14 It's okay .\n",
      "15 Love these shoes! Perfect fit, very comfortable even walking on concrete floors for 10 hours. They look good, feel sturdy. Excellent product, amazing value.\n",
      "16 Good\n",

      "22 Absolutely love!!\n",
      "23 Very sturdy. A great travel tote - lots of pockets and back pocket unzips at the bottom so you can place the bag over the handle of your suitcase for easy transport. Never travel without it!\n",
      "24 Comfortable just a little loose on my feet.\n",
      "25 it is comfortable\n",
      "26 Everithing was good\n",
      "27 I love this bag! I saw it at a boutique store for $78 and decided to see if it was on Amazon. Such a great price and it's an awesome, well-made bag w/ oodles of pockets for easy organization. Plus - lovely color!!\n",
      "28 Nice shoes but a little snug.\n",
      "29 Nice durability, comfortable and stylish.\n",
      "30 This pair of Sketchers is now the second pair I've bought, where the left shoe does not fit as well as the right.  The left is slightly loose.  I have the first pair of Go Walk Sketchers I bought, and they fit fine, so I have to assume the fault does not lie with my left foot.  Disappointed, given the price.\n",
      "31 I have flat feet that are large in width so the 1st few times they were a bit snug & uncomfortable to wear. After those few times they are most comfy casual shoes yet ......the material is made from bamboo so didn't help with the comfort the first few times wearing them either :(\n",
      "32 The boots are lights ,very confortable but the only thing that I did  not liked was are so tall.\n",
      "33 Not what I expected would not order again\n",
      "34 This is my second pair but different color. excellente.\n",
      "35 Slippers are adorable and so soft on the inside!  Love the rubber sole too.  Very comfortable!  My size is 8 and read from some reviewers that it runs a little larger in size, so I did go with size 6.5-7.5 and it fits wonderfully.\n",
      "36 It is larger than I anticipated.  I have not used it yet but it is brand new and will work great.\n",
      "37 Returned for a pair of Asics Cumulus. They were just okay, I ordered too big which was my own fault but I really didn't like the look of them all that much anyway once I got them. Not enough arch support for me, personally. Width was good, I have a wide foot. I'm kind of glad I didn't order the right size because I would have probably kept them. I am so much happier with the Asics I bought instead- I feel like I'm walking on a cloud. These shoes felt a little stiff like cardboard.\n",
      "38 Arch and ankle support are critical in this type of boot. This boots has that.\n",
      "39 These boots were order as the 9c which is the wide width when we received them the box and the shoes were marked 9b when we went to return these we were told that they were 9c's and were just mismarked well they were too narrow so we are now returning for refund would not suggest these if you are looking for a wide width.\n",
      "40 I love these shoes! I got them to wear around town because they look cute and comfortable, and they are. I added some insoles to add extra arch support for long walking days. Overall, excellent boots!\n",
      "41 I have had great luck with Brooks running shoes. They offer great stability and effectively cushion my feet.\n",
      "42 Very nice\n",
      "43 Fits as expected, fast delivery, very pleased.\n",
      "44 Cheep, made in China although they advertised as made in America, and they were a size too big. They are going back.\n",
      "45 Love them! I ordered a 1/2 size larger than normal.they fit perfect.great gym shoe.\n",
      "46 I initially bought an 11 and to exchange for a 12.They're fine now. I usually wear an 11 so I  guess they ran a little small. It could be the style of shoe rather than a dress oxford.\n",
      "47 Merrell are great boots, fit and feel great. I wear them everyday and on concrete floors. This is my third pair!\n",
      "48 Love these shoes!  Best hiking shoe i've ever had!\n",
      "49 Love these sandals!  Cushioning and comfortable yet attractive and easy to put on!\n",
      "50 To be fair they didn't fit me, which doesn't mean that they don't fit. Brooks makes a great shoe with great arch support.\n",
      "51 They're a lot darker than pictured. If backlit, you can see the tortoiseshell pattern but otherwise they just look a very dark brown. This was a bit disappointing to me but otherwise they're a good pair of sunglasses, they look well-made and they feel sturdy.\n",
      "52 love my boston's and now I love these. Finally they made a male flip flop.  Great comfort.\n",
      "53 Happy with the purchase\n",
      "54 I love it\n",
      "55 i do love the  sparkle of this bag,,,after all that was one of the reasons for purchasing it.... HOWEVER.... it is MISSING 2 RHINESTONE STUDS in the same area so the missing studs are quite noticeable! The other reason for the purchase is I like LARGE bags,,,while the size of this bag is okay the opening is small... disappointed in that...but oh well  when ordering online it is always a hit or miss!\n",
      "56 Perfect\n",
      "57 For my wife and she is super excited to have them for her first trip to Disney!\n",
      "58 Great Colors  Many Manny Compliments on these.  Just love them. I would recommend these to everyone.\n",
      "59 I loooooove this product so so much &#60;3.<br />It makes me look cool like superman\n",
      "60 I love these shoes.  So comfortable!\n",
      "61 Really love this style of shoe.  More sturdy than a slip on, but less bulky than a true sneaker. I had a pair in yellow that I got all greasy from biking, so I switched over to black.  They're holding up well, comfortable, and seem like they would survive a run through the washing machine if I wanted to clean them up.  Very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "62 Sweet\n",
      "63 Excellent shoe, great quality great price.\n",
      "64 I had to add inserts to the back of my heel because the size 6.5 was too small ad the size 7 was too big.  I have narrow heels.  With the inserts (they stick the the inside back of the shoe) they fit great!\n",
      "65 Terrific shoe at a reasonable price promptly delivered. Thanks!\n",
      "66 These boots have the typical timberland comfort.  They are not heavy to wear all day.  I do find that I need to lace them up pretty tight to keep my toes from rubbing the composite protective toe on the boot but all in all they seem like a good boot right from the box.  My rule of thumb is to get 1 year for every $100 I spend.  I would guess that in roughly a year the soles will start cracking which is also typical for timberland boots.  But they are work boots and I do beat them up for that year, and quite honestly they are comfortable.\n",
      "67 My grandson Sam loved them. He couldn't wait to try them on and show them to his cousins!\n",
      "68 Love them\n",
      "69 Oakley are always excellent quality glasses. The lenses are a nice strong green color that can't be seen through when worn.\n",
      "70 perfect fit and you can add another sole for extra comfort\n",
      "71 These shoes are by far the most comfortable wedges I've ever put on my feet. I HATE wearing heals but I love these shoes! I own them in black as well.\n",
      "72 I ordered this pair for my mother who has swollen feet and she LOVES these shoes!  She said they're comfortable, she likes the fact she can adjust the strap as needed, and they have fantastic support.  She wears these shoes all day long.  She has raved about them so much that I'm ordering a pair for myself!!\n",
      "73 I have purchased the sneaker before in the stores in white in a size 81/2. My true closed shoe size is 10.  Based on the reviews I decided to order the 9 and they fit perfect! So, measured your feet ladies and go with those measurements.\n",
      "74 Not as comfortable as they look\n",
      "75 It's a nice shoe that gives an outfit a pop of color.  Not a shoe to wear for periods of time if you have problem feet.\n",
      "76 The only complaint I have about these shoes is they do rub on the back of my heel, giving me a blister but they are extremely comfortable.  I would go up 1/2 size from what you normally wear in them too.\n",
      "77 I love these shoes. They are the most comfortable shoe I have found. The trouble is that I keep having to replace them every few months because  the soles separate from the shoes. Maybe New Balance could find out what kind of glue the other brands use because I am on my forth and final pair unless the quality control improves.\n",
      "78 My husband had the same shoes in another color.<br />Every day he had to walk 30min to work, and after work.<br />Very comfortable shoes\n",
      "79 As described\n",
      "80 I was actually very impressed with this little bag. I purchased mine in Coffee color. Shipping was fast.<br /><br />Every compartment zips which is nice with keeping things in. The main compartment has son padding witch gives the bag done structure and helps protect an iPad. It holds quite a bit but it's not a huge bag, my iPad mini fits nicely in its case with room to spare. The side pockets are great for an iPhone 5 in a fitted case but an iPhone 6 would be to big but the many othe pockets would work nicely.<br />The strap is soft and comfortable. The zippers are smooth and functional. My only complaint is the lining is a little cheap but it does not bunch up and get in the way.<br /><br />I usually carry Fossil or Vera Bradley bags. I got this for something different and small.\n",
      "81 Nice boots, purchased for short term protection during floods.  They are a little hot for southern weather, but are perfect to wear to get in and out of cars and buildings during heavy rains.\n",
      "82 These are super cute!  I wish they had been around when I got married!!  I was worried that it would be hard to see where I was going with the lettering and designs in the way, but it was just fine.  I could see without a problem.  I can't wait to give these to my brother and his soon to be wife at their wedding!  I was able to purchase these at a discount in exchange for my honest review.\n",
      "83 The purse is very pretty, but the clasp is very hard to open.  I was disappointed with this purse because of this.\n",
      "84 Very comfortable fits like they should got a great deal thanks to Amazon\n",
      "85 Before I purchase, I read a review which was about its small size. So, I ordered size 7 even though I usually wear 7.5 or 8. However, size 6 was arrived to my home. The funny thing was it fits to me and I am wearing the shoes. Consequently, tt is way smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Besides the size thing, it is comfortable and easy to wear and take off. If you are considering buying this, one thing you need to notice is that the rare part of the shoes is lower than common shoes.<br /><br />I satisfied this purchase but I gave 4 stars because of its small size.\n",
      "86 Second pairs of this model Gel-Kayano (#21). Fit as expected (they always run 1/2 size small).  I always order a second pair before the model changes - just in case the next one is off (happens every few years). Great support for narrow, flat, overprinting feet. I clock at least 15 miles/week walking and even used them for some light hiking recently (although it was a bit rough on them). I still have second pair in the box.\n",
      "87 I am a nurse and on concrete all day;  love the cushion;\n",
      "88 So far; so good. Bought these as a &#34;one pair does everything&#34; traveling shoe. After the first month of ownership and the first week-long trip I'm really satisfied. Shoes hold a shine well, look good with casual outfits, and will pass as dress shoes. Sizing seems to run true. I don't have any special arch support issues so I can't make a judgement on that attribute. The shoes are SUPER light weight, yet seem to be sturdy. The real test will be to see how long they last. (Hopefully this pair will be much better than the Keens they replaced.)\n",
      "89 I have bought at least a half a dozen pairs of these over the years. I love them. They mold to your feet and give great support. I wear them all year round. This pair, however, seemed to be a bit larger. My toes are sneaking out over the top edge and they are the same size I always get. I have never had that problem before. Makes me think I need to try shoes on rather than ordering online, even if it is the ones I have bought many times.\n",
      "90 Attractive style although a little wide.\n",
      "91 Not sized right.\n",
      "92 I bought these to wear at work (because I worked in a greenhouse, wet feet was an issue) and they were perfect for that because they were made to be wet, had  some traction, and protected my whole foot. When they arrived one of the eyelet guard things was broken, which was annoying but not something I cared to complain over. However, after less than a month of wearing them they began to rip apart at the seams. Sort of disappointing, I was hoping they would last a bit longer. Maybe I was expecting too much, to hope that a $35 pair of shoes would last for more than a month.\n",
      "93 Veri nice boots<br />Just to go out nothing special<br />Material should be more better.\n",
      "94 Just what I expected excellent\n",
      "95 Love them!! Just what I wanted.\n",
      "96 Great\n",
      "97 The strap along the big toes causes pain in the toes.\n",
      "98 From the toe, uncomfortable\n",
      "99 Love love love love them\n",
      "100 So freakin' cute!!! Love these & wearing them in Paris next month ❤️\n",
      "101 I like these, but not as much as the MT610V2s that these were meant to replace. They are great walking and light hiking shoes. They are sub-par running shoes compared to the MT610V2 versions.\n",
      "102 Loved the shoe but too small and did not come in my size.\n",
      "103 Great shoes for racquetball according to my husband for whom I ordered these.\n",
      "104 ASICS makes an excellent shoe for walking, just as they do for running. This one is incredibly comfortable. I'm on my feet all day, and this shoe is a winner.\n",
      "105 Bought these for my dad and he loves them!\n",
      "106 Very nice quality. I have large Oakley sunglasses and it fits them perfectly. Micro fiber bag and cloth are a real plus.\n",
      "107 I LOVE REEF flops!!!\n",
      "108 Love Reebok classics! Best fitting and most comfortable shoe. I'm on my feet at least 12 hours a day and my feet always feel great.\n",
      "109 They are legit and the price is great!\n",
      "110 Shoes are as great as I had expected from amazon.  Good job, thank you jerry\n",
      "111 Ouch what is going on in the front of these shoes? They pinched my toes badly.  Too bad they were cute but had to return.\n",
      "112 These shoes are great.  Very comfortable.  I wear a 5.5 and they are the perfect fit.  I am going to buy more in different colors.\n",
      "113 I like the style of the shoes. There is zero support though. Keds aren't known as an orthotic shoe so this is not unexpected. The ortholite footbed does almost nothing. The sole is thin so you can feel the unevenness of the ground/ pavement when you are out walking. For this reason, I would never recommend these shoes for walking. To run around to stores or anywhere indoors, they are fine as long as you add your own support inserts. I could not wear them for any extended period of time without my own insert.\n",
      "114 I'm in love with these! I get comments all the time. Perfect product for the price. Also comes with protective case and cleaning wipe so that is a bonus. If these came in additional colors I would for sure purchase more\n",
      "115 Ordered a size larger and still to small.\n",
      "116 Most comfortable kitchen shoes I've ever owned.\n",
      "117 Sent them back\n",
      "118 Nice shoe....runs a little small.  I would suggest buying one size bigger.\n",
      "119 Just cool great fit\n",
      "120 Good comfortable shoes. Fits nice and are affordable. What else could u ask for.\n",
      "121 loved it\n",
      "122 these shoes are are super comfortable!\n",
      "123 Super!\n",
      "124 Falling apart after only two times wearing them. Would not buy again.\n",
      "125 Loved the color and look of the shoes, the width was just fine. But....a few of the reviewers mentioned the shoes were running big.....they're recommendation was to get the shoes 1 size smaller....I did, that's why they were sent back!<br />TOO SMALL!  Doesn't even begin to express how small they were.....!<br /><br /> If anyone else is reading my review, just be aware of their comments, and then, buy the real size of shoes you normally wear.....!\n",
      "126 Just bought, feel light and very soft but need some time to check durability.\n",
      "127 Love them\n",
      "128 The back is too tall and very uncomfortable. I wore them and left my house in the morning and had to return in the afternoon to change them because they had already cut my upper heel. I love this brand but I do not recommend this model.\n",
      "129 I have 8/12 by 4E which might as well be a square foot or a Hobbits. New balance is the only shoe I can trust to buy online without trying on first.\n",
      "130 This BackPack is great. Very sturdy. Only thing gripe is the zippers on the front end. Sometimes they get stuck. I hope nothing worse comes of that issue. Either way, great value and i know this will last me at least 2 years or so.\n",
      "131 Bad this product is ugly , my girlfriend cut me of for this item\n",
      "132 Have always been a J Renee fan.  Love the shoes\n",
      "133 Loved how they felt while squatting, very stable and great for allowing me to hit depth. Definitely recommend for people with lack of ankle mobility. My biggest gripe and why it isn't 5 stars is that the shoes are super narrow. I don't have wide feet and these are still tight enough to cause a bit of discomfort towards the end of my lifting session.\n",
      "134 I'm on my feet all day, and I have tried many different brands of expensive shoes, including Dansko, MBT, Nike air max, Timberland etc. None of those brands are as comfortable as my work Crocs! I love them, and bought several extra pairs  to have as back-ups. They are so comfortable, and they require no break in period. They look good with slacks (business casual) or jeans, and they come in several colors. I have them in three different colors, and use them all regularly. I did have to order a size up, I usually wear a 7 1/2 and had to get the 8, which fits perfectly. The other plus is that they cost a fraction of what I paid for some of these other brands! Love, love, love these shoes!\n",
      "135 Stretched out the first time I wore them. Could not return, so they were no use to me.\n",
      "136 I was disappointed in the fit and it is impossible to keep the shoes on my feet when I am walking.  I love Finn shoes- this is my second pair and the styling and quality are very good.  However, with shoes - it is all about fit!  The arch support on these is not nearly as good as my prior pair of Finn.  I love that the straps (both) are adjustable but I still can't keep them on my feet when I am walking.  I really needed a pair of sandals that I could wear to work and make the walk into work comfortably.  These don't work.  I'm basically using them as house shoes to wear around the house.  I apparently need a higher heel or a back strap in order to walk comfortably and keep the shoes on my feet.\n",
      "137 Comfortable and Stylish but A Little Small. I'd say go one size bigger than your usual shoe.\n",
      "138 nice light-weight golf shoe - no problem walking 18 holes\n",
      "139 The main reason I purchased these insoles is to help with my metatarsalagia from running. They are very cushion-y and have allowed me to run with no pain. One drawback is that they are super thick, especially in the arch to heal. I would have preferred to have more cushion for the ball of my foot and less in the arch/heel.<br /><br />That being said, I'm running comfortably again and will be able to complete the half marathon I'm training for, so that's a huge plus!\n",
      "140 These sneakers provide excellent comfort to my soles! Two thumbs up!\n",
      "141 Since I got these for $14.99 I have to say I got an incredible bargain and they're very comfortable.\n",
      "142 Very nice for the price.  As pictured and fast delivery\n",
      "143 Yeah--I love this bag.  Only gave it a 4--which is somewhat unfair, since these are MY issues and it is described online perfectly:  it's a little (pun unintended) too small.  Also, I like everything about the design EXCEPT a deeper pocket in back would be better & an open pocket in front in addition to the 2 zippered pockets.<br />I had a leather bag exactly as described above.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to find another!\n",
      "144 super cute, sadly they were not comfortable for me. But I have foot problems and the wedge put just enough pressure on the ball of my foot that I couldn't keep them. They are really nice, I wish I could have kept them.\n",
      "145 The color was Black instead of Navy. Otherwise everything was as expected.\n",
      "146 I wish that they were offered in other colors.  I would buy them in all colors offered.\n",
      "147 I bought these boots about 4 months ago and recently decided to read some of the stuff other people said about them. I want to clear something up that ive read in some comments on the boots. These boots are fairly thick leather and have a long break in period if they hurt your feet thats just how its going to be for a little while the only advice i have to offer people with that problem is bet better insoles and you can ride out the stiffness and then realize these are very well priced. Only complaint is the massive price increase for large sizes i wear a 14 US or aka the 13 UK and paid 150 were someone with like a 9 US paid 80 when I bought them a while back. Notice in the picture all the creases those don't happen overnight so again just ride it out\n",
      "148 I love them but they were just too small so I gave them to a friend and ordered myself a larger pair.  The faux chinchilla is wonderful.\n",
      "149 Beatiful shoes!\n",
      "150 Versatile cross body and will fit more than you think.\n",
      "151 I lifeguarded throughout the summer and was scared to use my $200 pair of ray bans, I found these on Amazon and they were great for wear and tare purposes. By the end of the three months of wearing them throughout the day they had little scratches but they got the job done. The fact that they are polarized helped a lot. They are very light because they are made out of all plastic but I didn't mind, I knew that by the end of summer I would probably toss them.\n",
      "152 These are great in an arsenal of basic sneakers. They give a slim profile and are very cozy. The leather/suede upper is a great touch, but does not clean easily. These are a flatfooted shoe, so if you have problems with arch support you should definitely consider alternative footwear for daily out-and-about.<br /><br />Add to this that they are affordable. I wear them regularly Sp/Su/F and get about 2 years of wear which is above par as far as many sneakers go.\n",
      "153 The shoes fit as expected, and the only reason that I didn't post 5 stars is that they didn't seem to wear very well. What I mean is, after about the thrid time I wore them, on the right shoe, the glue began seperating from the toe. I didn't stub it or anything, and only wore these to the YMCA to excercise, but they just kind of started falling apart. The fifth time I wore them, one of the loops on the heel came off. They were shipped quickly and the packaging was right for the item enclosed.\n",
      "154 My daughter has 3 pairs.  When I visited her I tried them out and went home and ordered my own.  I love them.  Comfortable, stylish and nothing between the toes!!!\n",
      "155 I haven't taken these into the water just yet, but wanted to comment on the size for others who are looking. I normally wear a U.S. women's size 7.5 to 8 in shoes. Assuming I would want a snug fit for water shoes I sized down to the 7s in these and they were very loose which would have caused a lot of drag and slipping walking on river beds and such. I received the 6 today and they feel like a perfect fit, snug enough that I am hopeful they'll maintain this comfort when wet. These are shown as women's sizes, but as I wear a 6 in men's athletic shoes, I'd suggest just buying whatever your men's equivalent size would be...<br /><br />I will try to update once I wear these out but so far I'm pleased now that I have found the right fit.\n",
      "156 Excellent product!  Arrived  on time\n",
      "157 From my granddaughter's wish list; as far as I know, she loves them and wears them all the time.\n",
      "158 Very cute shoes, however, they dug into my heels after a couple of hours.\n",
      "159 These are very cute shoes and are very comfortable for the most part. They run slightly narrow but not too uncomfortably so. The insole is nice and soft and the rest of the shoe is well constructed. The only reason for 4 stars (rather than 5) is that the heel is somewhat abrasive, like many shoes. This is an easy fix with a couple of small band-aids or socks that come up high enough in the back.\n",
      "160 These are the most comfortable sandals I own and I love the purple/pink color! I usually wear a size 7.5 in nike athletic shoes, since sandals normally run a bit smaller than athletic shoes I ordered a size 7 in women's and they fit perfect. They are slightly wider than thong sandals but they were not too wide and I think the slightly bigger width adds to the comfort. I normally don't like slide sandals because they fall off my feet but these are made of a special rubber and they kind of stick to your foot so they don't fall off easily. The rubber sole on these feel like those anti fatigue kitchen mats, I think they are much more comfortable than the memory foam sandals nike makes. The only reason I rated these 4 instead of 5 stars was the price. I know the purple/pink color is hard to find but these shoes really shouldn't cost over $30 and the ones I bought were $56 so they were overpriced. You can get the black color for $30 at most stores, however I have only been able to find them in mens sizes. For reference I wear a size 7 in womens but when I ordered the black pair I wore a size 6 in mens (even though the chart said I should get a 5). Would I buy these again for $56, probably not, but I really wanted the purple/pink color and they were a splurge. I still love these shoes though and they are exceptionally comfortable, you won't be disapointed!\n",
      "161 Fit well, great for mowing grass on sunny days.\n",
      "162 It's a tiny little metal shoe horn. I guess it's cheaper to make these out of metal. I think it's better to get a plastic one, though. There is no reason to make this out of metal. If you're worried about a plastic one snapping then you've got bigger issues.<br /><br />Covered in black paint. The edges seem smooth. Haven't had any problems with jagged edges catching on my socks.\n",
      "163 Good product... good frame and glass but I didn't like how it looked on me.\n",
      "164 Well, I have a problem, the item was smaller than expected. I would like to know if there's a way to make a change because they are really small.<br />If you can help me I would really appreciate, my email is japf1492@gmail.com Thank you so much.\n",
      "165 Shoe as expected\n",
      "166 Can't find these glasses anywhere anymore.<br /> Love pocket clip\n",
      "167 Awesome shoe.  I'm getting a lot of compliments on them too.\n",
      "168 The shoes ran small and the clasp was broken when it arrived. Unfortunately I didn't realize it was broken until I had already worn them. I'm very disappointed.\n",
      "169 Son asked for these to be ordered to use while in military to train. Shoes held up well and gave good support during ten weeks of training, .\n",
      "170 I like these shoes and would buy again, but the arch support should be better, hence 4 out of 5\n",
      "171 Thank you !\n",
      "172 Perfect\n",
      "173 Bought these and once they were delivered put them on immediately.  They are a marvelous pair of Fivefingers! Soft leather gives this pair an understated classic look when compared to normal fivefingers sporty get noticed colors.  I use these for extensive travel. Fit is perfect for average size 12.5 foot size,  quality of materials great, quality of workmanship is there too.  I WISH I DID BUY MORE OF THESE.\n",
      "174 Very cute, but large on my 14mo. She's in the 50% for height and weight, so average sized baby, but these won't fit her for awhile.\n",
      "175 The shoes are very comfortable however the sizing, according to my foot doctor, runs a bit small.  She pointed out how close the toes are resting at the very end of the insert.\n",
      "176 Love these\n",
      "177 I love these shoes but I got the wrong size\n",
      "178 These fit as expected and are great for any kiddo with a wide foot!\n",
      "179 Love them\n",
      "180 Initially they were pretty tight, second time I wore them they seemed to have stretched out, so much so that I am concerned after repeated wearing they would become way to big. Also, after wearing them for over an hour in the house, my feet began to sweat quite a bit. As much as I like them, the style and color and I really like Merrell shoes, I'm afraid I am going to return them because of the sweaty feet and fear of after complete break in I would walk right out of them.\n",
      "181 There is always the stigma of purchasing shoes online that they will never fit perfectly. Well luckily enough I was able to try these shoes on at the store and get the correct fit that I liked. They came in 3 days above schedule and did what shoes do . Only wish I got them in a different color\n",
      "182 Nice shoes, comfortable!\n",
      "183 Beautiful and incredibly comfortable! Wore the for over 16 hours on a very busy day with lots of walking involved and my feet were not hurting at all by the end of the day.\n",
      "184 super cute! love!\n",
      "185 The first time I put them on the zipper broke. Until now I couldn't remember where I bought them.  A total loss of my money.  No more Jessica Simpson for me!!  Thank you for nothing  Nancy Ffrench  Yes it is Ffrench with a double f\n",
      "186 Daughter very pleased with these boots.  Seem well made.  Nice rugged bottoms.\n",
      "187 High end tri-fold wallet, with bill compartment, coin pouch, many card slots and a window pocket. This stylishly designed wallet is perfect for any one.  This luxury wallet is made of genuine cow leather and the quality is great.\n",
      "188 These were for my 11 year old 'princess'.  She LOVES anything with sparkles & heels!!  So these were a huge hit with her.  She wears them EVERYWHERE and has had adults wish they could get them in their size!\n",
      "189 Super cute and comfy. Until they have now failed. With a huge open crack in them where the foot bends. Right shoe now useless. I am so disappointed that I can not return for refund. Vendor should take the hit on these, not me. They did not even last the full season I bought them for.\n",
      "190 I uv it\n",
      "191 First of all I order the shoe in black. All identifications (labeling on box) indicated that the box contained the correct shoe. Unfortunately, upon opening the box I found a navy blue/white mixed shoe. Once over my anger, I tried the shoes on, they were very comfortable. I wear them all day and my feet does not burn or hurt. I have ordered another pair, hopefully they will be black as I requested.\n",
      "192 Love these shoes. They're very comfortable and they are extremely breathable which is important when you're trying to stay cool in the hot summer months.\n",
      "193 I want to send them back.\n",
      "194 Size is perfect and Amazon maintain the delivery schedule.\n",
      "195 I love these shoes! They are exactly as they appear in the picture and are comfortable! I normally wear an 8.5 and ordered that size but they run a tad large. They will be perfect in the fall/winter with thick socks. I was happy with them and was impressed at how fast I received them after placing my order.\n",
      "196 Easy Spirit is my go-to sneaker. They had discontinued the style I preferred but these are a perfect replacement. I have a heel spur and trouble with foot cramps with most shoes but these are comfortable and do not cause me a bit of problem. Relatively inexpensive for a sneaker but I'll be buying another set soon because they are perfect for me.\n",
      "197 The shoes fit great and are really comfortable!\n",
      "198 just great.\n",
      "199 The sole broke in one shift. And by broke I mean I had a chunk fall off. Service was not very nice about it either\n",
      "200 June just a smidge small  compared to normal addidas but not enough to go up a size. Loom amazing, even the tread is retro. My new favorite shoe.\n",
      "201 I love the style of these sunglasses, but they are not, as described above, polarized.  They failed every test of polarization.  But if you don't care about this anti-glare technology -- or don't want it since it makes it difficult to look at electronic screens such as GPS devices and cell phones -- then these might be for you.  Even though they have that retro style, they are modern enough to look chic.  They have floating silicone nose pads for comfort; thin gold-tones wire rims on the bottom of the lenses; and a plastic tortoise shell frame top that extends into the arms as well.  These sit comfortably on my face without sliding down my nose.  Besides the lack of polarization, the only thing I'm not wild about is the style of the bridge -- the gold-tone design looks a little cheap, much more so than the rest of the glasses.  For the current price of $20, these are priced right and are a great choice for the style.  Note:  I received a free sample for review.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\n",
      "202 It not only hurt my feet, but the &quot;design&quot; on the front of one was more pronounced than on the other.\n",
      "203 My husband is a size 11.5 but after reading the reviews - it says to order 2 sizes up or they become uncomfortable on the heel part. I ordered 13 and were too big! No problem with return. The sz 12 fit better.\n",
      "204 These really hurt my feet. Angled so your foot crams into the front. Gave me a blister.\n",
      "205 Love them\n",
      "206 very comfortable\n",
      "207 well, tecnically, my wife loves them. She's a life-long Birkie fan, and these sandals did not disappoint.\n",
      "208 LOVE LOVE LOVE !!!!!\n",
      "209 Love these shoes, much more comfortable than others I have tried\n",
      "210 I don't wear anything else!!  They are light weight and a great rose color.. I ski and swim in them with no problems!  The lenses are sooo clear!\n",
      "211 perfect color for my work uniform, comfy and clean. Might buy more.\n",
      "212 I love this bag!!!!  Great tote for work and also Alabama roll tide roll!!!\n",
      "213 These shoes were everything that I have come to expect from a Rockport product.\n",
      "214 The color is odd- more purple than blue. My son said he could not wear.<br />Sent back and paid $15 for shipping. So much for Prime\n",
      "215 Gave me sores just below my Achilles tendon.  I hope I can wear them once they heal!!\n",
      "216 So I have bad heel spurs in both my feet so I cant wear a lot of shoes if they dont offer good arch support. I love Fila shoes and saw these and bought them. Its always a risk for me. I got them and wore them to walk around the mall to try them out. They are actually amazing. The sole and arch support are perfect. It felt like I was walking on air and I had no issue wearing them the entire day. I am very happy with them because I never get to wear the shoes that are comfortable and I love how they look. These are the only exception. Oh did I mention they are affordable?\n",
      "217 I love them.\n",
      "218 I've been trying to find a Travelon or Travelon-like bag for a while but have been having a hard time with sizing (not too big and not too small).  This does the trick.  Right now, I have an iPad mini, Vera Bradley wallet and makeup bag, small notebook, iPhone 6s (in a thin case), keys, work ID, flash drive and many other bits and pieces and everything fits nicely. I've read other reviews, on other sites, complaining about the short handle and slightly smaller opening.  I'm a 5', full sized gal and the short handle fits well over my arms.  The cross body strap, fully open, had the bag knocking against my shin. So I know I'm going to be able to wear it, comfortably, with a coat.  I wanted to get away from the &#34;all black bag&#34; habit, so I tried the blue.  It's actually a nice neutral color.  Well made, good size, RFID protection, ample storage and a crazy great price on Amazon.  Works for me!\n",
      "219 slim than i expected<br />got it on time\n",
      "220 LOVE LOVE LOVE - a lot brighter then I normally wear but absolutely love these shoes!\n",
      "221 Used for my corssfit training. Fits well for my 9.5 us and light enough to do box jumps and rope climbs\n",
      "222 I came home form a week in the boundary waters, portaging over the granite rocks, gravel, in and out of the canoe, up and over hills, climbing small waterfalls, and the shoes were great........came home and bought a second pair.\n",
      "223 Love it..\n",
      "224 I was hoping for a nice pair of slippers I could wear around my home. What I got was something so horrifically uncomfortable that I decided that I'd rather go barefoot. After taking one step in them, I put the slippers back in the box and returned them.\n",
      "225 My daughter loves them!\n",
      "226 First of all these are NOT $65 sandals. I'm glad I got them on sale for $34 but I still wish I never bought them. I bought them for the arch support, which it has, but there are other things about the sandals that completely negate the whole arch support thing and make them really uncomfortable. The foot bed material feels nice and soft but the entire outer edge of the sandal comes up almost like it's forming a cup so that your toes don't lay flat. Instead they are forced upward in a weird position so that the rest of the foot sloped downward into the cupped part and my foot suctions into it as I walk. It's annoying and weird. The raised edge makes sense on most of the sandal except for the toes. I don't really get it. They should lay flat because it would make the arch support do what it's supposed to do. Also the strap that goes between the toes is very hard and hurts my toes. I expected a little better construction for the original $65 price. I guess $34 seems about right if they were more comfortable. My feet always hurt as it is but these make them feel worse. I really wanted to like them. I never leave reviews but I just had to with these.\n",
      "227 I love these sandals. I liked them so much I bought a second pair. The heel is just right, the craftsmanship and materials what I expected for the price. They're a little bit wide for my narrow foot but they make up for it in style and quality. Many compliments.\n",
      "228 I love this shoe...Will be buying another pair in 3 months. Comfortable and Awesome!\n",
      "229 These are fine. The frames are flexible, which is different but nice. I like that they're polarized. They're cute. They came packaged well and in a bag so the lenses were in perfect condition.<br /><br />I think they run pretty large. I was disappointed in their sizing. They fit me pretty well. And yes, I have a petite face, but I'm still an adult.  These were massive on my 3.5yo.\n",
      "230 Will not purchase because of the white top stitching--detracts from an otherwise appealing a sandal!\n",
      "231 then design and durability is great. too cheap for its quality.\n",
      "232 Majority of my shoes are Cole Haan. These Slip-ons require some softening of the top, back ankle of the shoe. Wearing these with socks looks ridiculous. I did not think about getting cuts on the back of my ankles. The Ivory color is what I have. You may be very disappointed if these get dirty. The material is cloth/linen which is a bit difficult to clean dark marks off a light colored shoe.\n",
      "233 While these shoes are super cute and I adore the print, they are a bit narrow for my wider feet. I can only really wear them to work (a desk job) but I  do get a TON of compliments on them when I do. So I guess it evens out!\n",
      "234 Way too big!!\n",
      "235 These boots are good for my wide feet (I ordered a 6.5 wide) and that is my normal size.  I have problems with bunions but the leather is soft and after a few wearings they conformed to the bunions on my feet.  My arches have fallen so I need a good supportive shoe/boot and these have great arch support!\n",
      "236 I recommend excellent product . All very good\n",
      "237 This shoes are just perfect. Casual style Wich I love. Beautiful brown color. Very good quality. Bought them for fall season. So excited! My size is 8,5, i ordered my size, but now thinking that I should order 1 size up.\n",
      "238 I live in the country and it's nice to easily kick these off at the door.\n",
      "239 Bought for my son first day at school. It's practical, easy and very comfortable since he's so active.\n",
      "240 so very comfortable!\n",
      "241 I LOVE THIS PURSE GREAT QUALITY\n",
      "242 Love it\n",
      "243 They do help!\n",
      "244 My boyfriend loved them!\n",
      "245 Loved It!!!\n",
      "246 The perfect show for my lifestyle.\n",
      "247 Gorgeous shoes fit wonderfully! I do not have skinny calves 14.5 and they are fine!\n",
      "248 Love them fit like a glove very comfortable\n",
      "249 I thought their would be fur throughout the inside of the boot but it ended at the ankle. I was expecting them to be warmer but overall good boot.\n",
      "250 Don't put anything on the inside pockets. The magnetic clasps don't hold\n",
      "251 I was really disappointed when these shoes did not fit. I am a size 10...in every shoe I own....and these had my toes crammed up against the front of the shoe. I was going to take them to Disney World and was so disappointed that I could not walk around my living room without discomfort, much less a day at the Park. If you are able to order a half size larger than what you normally wear, that is the way to go, in my opinion. They are adorable in every way and would probably be very supportive and cushioned, if worn in the right size.\n",
      "252 O love it\n",
      "253 Would have given another star but the lighter color on the sole isn't my preference. I prefer darker since they get dirty quickly.\n",
      "254 These are my first Crocs, but they won't be my last.  I usually wear a 9W and these were a 10.  At first, they were too big (ie, long), but soon, the extra room was shifted to account for my wide food.  I know they're supposed to be anti-microbial, so I'm anxious to see if my feet will stink or not (they always used to before I started wearing only leather shoes).  My husband is SUPER picky about shoes' appearance and even HE likes them.  Unfortunately there are 2 holes on the arch of each shoe.  I'm guessing they are for ventilation.  Without them, they would be perfect for walking in the rain, or puddles or mud.  Sure wish I'd had these when I was riding buses to get to work.\n",
      "255 this are for my nephew, he runs track in high school. he said these fit good and the spikes are the right size. the color is cool. and they come in a lot of colors. he would buy more.\n",
      "256 I've used these in the gym, for hiking, and for everyday use.<br /><br />They're built to last and are rather comfortable. Highly recommend for anyone looking for an all around shoe.\n",
      "257 Good\n",
      "258 Had to Return, unable to wear, they run wide. Not for a narrow foot.\n",
      "259 i love it, its so cute, gives you an Indian feel\n",
      "260 Brother loved it\n",
      "261 Very suitable\n",
      "262 Attractive black bag. Nice size when a wristlet is too small. I would feel comfortable gifting this.\n",
      "263 Love these!  so cute, I have gotten so many compliments on them...good quality, great purchase!\n",
      "264 My son played in one football game with these shoes and they began to fall apart.  The soles/cleats started separating from the shoe in the heel area during the first game.  The trainers had to tape the soles/cleats to help prevent additional separation and injury prior to the second game.  If cleats separate during play it could lead to a serious injury.  Stay away from these shoes.\n",
      "265 Too large. Does not cut down to a 7W or fit in my Propet shoe like it said it would.<br /><br />They don't cut down well on the sides, so they don't fit width-wise in my sneakers. They're also too thick for my Propet Mary-Janes, so in the end they were not what I wanted. I realized that the insoles I need are not very typical, but I was hoping these would work....<br /><br />It was a couple hours before it gave me blisters on the top of my foot. It was too tall, so my foot rubbed bad against the top of my shoe.<br /><br />When I finally got it in my shoe, the arch was in the wrong place. So maybe it would have given me good arch support if they were in the right place?\n",
      "266 These flip-flops are extremely comfortable and look cute with shorts, skirts, dresses, or jeans.\n",
      "267 The fit was very good and comfortable.\n",
      "268 They came fast and the quality was great, however they did not come with the ankle buckles, and i was very upset.\n",
      "269 I am going to note that these are my daughters so I cant give a good review.\n",
      "270 Really like the shoes good quality.  Have added insole for example training comfort and added growth.inside of shoe lined well no sharp seams.very soft soles.\n",
      "271 fits perfectly\n",
      "272 It is very nice but the size was a little bit big.\n",
      "273 So so\n",
      "274 Ok I love the shoes but I can only look at it because it can't fit. What is my normal size that I purchase for other shoes seem not to be the standard size as expected that really disappointing since I was waiting enjoy this product which is now a waste. Really disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "275 I like the look of it. I'm 5'1&#34; and it comes down to my knees. I tried to put a knot, but then it was to small to go over my head and shoulder.\n",
      "276 It's very beautiful and has enough space to put everything in.\n",
      "277 Excelente...\n",
      "278 If you are looking for comfort shoes, these are the ones. Pretty, cozy, and comfort are what I can say about these clogs. I like the pattern of the upper which is a combination of two different textures in two different red tones, very subtle, yet pretty. They would be a great to wear in autumn and winter! You would feel warmed up instantly! I don't normally wear clogs because I thought they were for generations of my mom and beyond, but I started to change my mind after trying these on =) My feet feel phenomenal in them. The insoles are super cushioned. So is the lining of the shoes.<br /><br />For the fit, they run mall (as in narrow and short) for wide feet. I got a pair in 8M/W (width: 3-3/8&#34; to 3.5&#34;, length: 9.5&#34;; I didn't exactly understand what that sizing system meant when it had both M and W in it!); and they fit my wide feet very perfectly. I have wide feet but slender heels; and I usually wear 7.5M in closed-toe shoes and 8M-9M in boots (depending on the brands and designs). The long-vamp design covers most of the upper part of my feet, which makes it a little challenging to put them on. However, my feet do not slip out of these shoes while walking. As a result, I'd suggested that if you have wide feet, definitely go at least 1 size up. If you have narrow feet, I would recommend you go with your true clog size.\n",
      "279 Somewhat narrow.\n",
      "280 These are her favorite boots by far and they are super cute. I did notice some scuffing on the toes after about three days but in all fairness she was playing on blacktop at school.  These boots would definitely be best for dress and not play. But try telling that to a seven-year-old with a boot addiction!\n",
      "281 My wife has shoe fitting problems and it is not the boot. The use is for costuming and it works well for the time she wears them.\n",
      "282 Slippers fell apart in a few days and stretched out so bad my feet were slipping.  The company refunded with no problems.\n",
      "283 I have worn Ariat paddock boots for a long time. This Ariat hiking boot is so much more comfortable, the sole support is really good. Great for all day walking.\n",
      "284 Good product\n",
      "285 Smaller than my actual size\n",
      "286 Good\n",
      "287 I'm fall in love on it! Soft leather shoes. Very comfortable, even if you have to walk all day.\n",
      "288 They re good flip-flops. Pretty durable too. My last pair lasted me about 5 years.\n",
      "289 great shoe! many compliments! fit as expected!!! I love them!!\n",
      "290 These are my son's favorite shoes, we try to get Fallen every time.\n",
      "291 the color is not what it look in the picture, to pale,\n",
      "292 Excellent!\n",
      "293 Exceptional shoes in comfort and style.\n",
      "294 I've had this shoe before and they fit great.\n",
      "295 I love this case\n",
      "296 I could stand and walk for days in these shoes. Great for brisk waking, work, dancing... You name it!  I have bad bunion pain and very low insteps and these easily accommodate custom orthotics too. I order a size down and they always fit.\n",
      "297 Delivery was quick and there were absolutely now problems !\n",
      "298 I wear between a 7 and a 7.5 but usually but go smaller on heels and larger on boots. These are a little snug, but I don't mind that as I don't like it when they are too big and keep slipping off my heels. The color and shoes are really pretty and will wear well to church and work. Glad I purchased.\n",
      "299 GREAT, SNUGGLY FIT, THANKS SO MUCH !!!!\n",
      "300 very good shoes. the color is more blue than gray\n",
      "301 Perfect ~\n",
      "302 Very bright red. Lot's of compliments.\n",
      "303 1st Glance: Packaging & instructions were great and provided value. Easy to follow along and replace lenses and even came with a new pouch for my shades.  One strange thing I noticed and maybe it was just me. When walking with the sun in my face I started to get a slight headache or a dull pain behind my eyes.  I'm not sure if the sun was too bright for this specific polarization but it reminded me of wearing an incorrect prescription of glasses.  Once sitting and reading at the pool, I no longer noticed this issue.<br /><br />4 Weeks In: Starting to notice some a whole bunch of tiny spec marks out of the front of the lenses. I am not noticing a loss in the quality of my vision but from up close they do not look like they did when I purchase these. I clean these with a cleaning kit from Sun Glass hut (where I purchased my other Oakley's).  I haven't seen this isse with my other sunglasses which i've had for a few months longer.\n",
      "304 Love these shoes\n",
      "305 I wear size 15 in other shoes, including NB, but the NB 15s and even 16s were too small.\n",
      "306 Just okay.  Worth the money if you only golf once and a while.  Not waterproof, but they are good shoes for an amateur golfer.\n",
      "307 Always like these shoes!!\n",
      "308 Great shoe at a great price!\n",
      "309 These are great for my work shoes. I wear an 11 and the XL fit perfectly. The smell of the wood is amazing and leaves my shoes fresh and in great shape. Thanks.\n",
      "310 SInce they discontinued my favorite Ultra Sendor this is next best thing.\n",
      "311 Great price for these.\n",
      "312 These shoes feel really good in my feet. The only thing is that while I was breaking them, it seems like they stretched a lot. Before they stretched they were almost perfect. I bought a size smaller of these shoes from a different company & they were way too small. These shoes are great. They just don't quite fit like my Dansko's do.\n",
      "313 Love this style. Fit great and are very comfortable.\n",
      "314 Almost three sizes too small!\n",
      "315 These running shoes are terrific and I am very pleased with the support. Asides is a good brand.\n",
      "316 Love the shoe!  Have worn it for years. Very durable and comfortable!  Wouldn't wear anything else to play pickleball!\n",
      "317 Awesome shoes... My favorite Cole Haan´s!! You will never regret to buy them!!\n",
      "318 Great looking shoes and they fit well.  My only remorse it that the buckles are a pain in the back-side to get on and off.\n",
      "319 The shoe is beautiful but I ordered a size 7M and a size 10 was delivered instead.\n",
      "320 The shoes were cute and stylish, but the tops were too tight/narrow.  I couldn't squeeze my average-width feet into them, nor would the material stretch very easily, so I had to return them.\n",
      "321 VERY CUTE AND GREAT QUALITY\n",
      "322 Small\n",
      "323 Cute! Fits just slightly smaller than the other three pairs in the same size off Amazon. All the pairs were the same size and fit as expected but these fit just slightly smaller and my foot hits close to the back edge. With that said, cute cute cute! They also seem to be nice quality.. It will be interesting to see if the Rhinestones fall out of the bottom rim over time with use or collect dirt in between. I guess time will tell, for now I am happy!\n",
      "324 Great purchase fast delivery time.. Very satisfied with my purchase\n",
      "325 I have Morgan-nueroma in my left foot and had to give up shallow water aerobics because of the pain. I tried wearing a regular pair of sneakers in the pool but they were completely in appropriate for that use as they soaked up the water like a sponge. I also tried a regular pair of water shoes but there was no support. These Merrell Men's Water shoes however are working out great and now I am able to go back to the classes that I'm able to do with my bad back.I thought they were a little pricey but in the end well worth it.\n",
      "326 Nice fit.\n",
      "327 My daughter loves them.  They look really cute with her leggings and seem to keep her little feet warm in the winter.\n",
      "328 I am giving these boots a 4 even though I am sending  them back. The quality is great and it really is a beautiful boot which is why I am rating it as I am. However,  I have short (5'2&#34;) and muscular legs (14&#34;) but these boots are too wide for my legs. They look like rain galoshes which is not at all cute. I am between a 7.5 and 7 shoe size and ordered the 7 and felt the boots were too long on my foot as well. Sending these back...perhaps I'll try the non-wide calf version in a 6.5? The boot hunt continues.\n",
      "329 The bag looks as pictured, but you have to put the strap in the front yourself. A bit annoying.\n",
      "330 This is a going to the store shoe. It didn't last 2 months at work before the sole started falling off. Thank goodness they were on sale.\n",
      "331 This is the third pair of Keen shoes that I have purchased and they are great. I was a little apprehensive about buying them online but after reading the reviews and considering the input from multiple reviewers I went ahead and ordered the shoes. I did order them a half size larger than I normally wear and they fit perfectly.\n",
      "332 These are super cute flats, I love the pewter color!  They don't have much for arch support, but they are flats after all and I didn't expect much to begin with.. However for the price and the look, I will still be happy!\n",
      "333 This boot is great holds up against chemicalss and it is the most waterproof work boot I have tried, and fits so very comfortable. Glad I finally found this boot\n",
      "334 thank you\n",
      "335 While I liked the previous model better, this seems to be a suitable replacement, but not an upgrade or improvement....Why do shoe companies keep changing the models? Sometimes the one you have is great and doesn't need to be tweaked.\n",
      "336 I got these for my husband and he loves them.  They are amazingly comfortable.\n",
      "337 Wore these to WLC without having broken them in but that wasn't a problem.  I did get a few blisters but they seemed minimal compared to what I've experienced from GI boots besides my feet weren't at all conditioned and I expected a few foot issues from long road marches.  These babies are light and were a dream doing land nav.  For those who like to do an airborne shuffle or slow jog when doing land nav or when rucking, these are on point.  I usually wear a 7 1/2 but sized up to an 8 based on other reviews and they fit perfectly.\n",
      "338 There really isn't a lot of support for running. Even for long walks I had to put an insert in for more support. Pro's- they're super light, awesome grip and no need to break them in much. Also they're really cute!\n",
      "339 I wear these only for aerobics classes. I replaced the insole with an orthotic since it didn't have the arch support I need for a Morton's neuroma. Toe space is a bit cramped. I went a half size larger than my usual Skechers but for exercising, I could have used another half size up. A good but not great shoe compared to other Skechers I have owned.\n",
      "340 I have to say, the reason I bought these was because I am a huge Duchess of Cambridge fan and she has these.  Having said that, if I didn't like them, I would have returned them....but I love them!  They fold up small and have a little case that can fit in a small purse.  They aren't polarized, but they block out the sun pretty good.\n",
      "341 Was pleasantly surprised as to how comfortable these are!  Great value for the price.\n",
      "342 I'm usually an 8-1/2 in American brands but in this shoe I would have to be a 9-1/2 which is the size I buy in European brands.<br />Overall I like the look and feel of the shoe but it's hard to comment since the size is so off.\n",
      "343 I had to return these as I'd ordered an 8 C and they were definitely not a wide shoe, nor properly fitting lengthwise.  Pretty disappointing.  The uppers were a little cheap looking, which I could let go for a less than $40 shoe, but the soles were cheap and slippery with no traction.  I had them on my feet for about 45 seconds before I sighed and put them back in the box.\n",
      "344 Great shoe.  I normally wear 8.5 - 9 shoes.  I wish I had gone for size 9 but the 8.5 fits fine as well.  As mentioned in another review, go for the larger of the sizes if you're between sizes.  I use these shoes for mountain biking and the grip is amazing!\n",
      "345 I purchased this shoe to replace an old Naturalizer slip on that i loved but had finally worn out. I ordered the same size (wide) as my old shoe, but this Naturalizer shoe was both shorter and narrower and too tight for me. I was also surprised at the lack of arch support in this shoe. It seemed like it would be a comfortable shoe for someone with smaller feet and who doesn't need much arch support.\n",
      "346 Within one wearing, the shoes molded to my feet and felt great.  By the second time, I could walk for hours.\n",
      "347 This is my second pair of these. Enough said!\n",
      "348 Love them\n",
      "349 Very pleased and will purchase in other colors.\n",
      "350 The shoes are super cute but unfortunately, they are almost 2 sizes too big and way too wide. Had to return them and get different ones.\n",
      "351 Very good shoe at a bargain price.  I really enjoyed the quick delivery.  Quality of the shoe is as expected - very good ankle support, comfortable and light - excellent for tennis.\n",
      "352 I love these... Planning to order another pair!!\n",
      "353 Excellent. I received more than expected for the price.  In addition to the sunglasses themselves, they came in a hard case with a folded soft case as an option and a few other extra accessories.\n",
      "354 I love this style of Keen so much that I bought a black pair in addition to the brown pair I have. Comfortable and functional yet stylish. I get many compliments on them. Since they are closed toe, I can wear them on the job\n",
      "355 Great for by the ocean. My son loves them!\n",
      "356 Do yourself a favor and add these boots to your cart!!! You know you want to!!! I had always been a true size 7 in my adult life but since becoming pregnant, toting my son around for 9 months and now an additional 3 since he's been born, my feet have gotten super wide and none of my shoes seem to fit so I've sized up to 7.5/8. I thought to order a 7.5 in these but based on reviews stuck with the 7 (since they seem to run large) and crossed my fingers that they'd fit. Well they arrived this am and I am ecstatic!!! These are gorgeous and so supple and have room for even my thickest socks on these wide momma feet! The unlined leather does grip but with boots this gorgeous take a second to appreciate putting them on! I already can wait to order more from bed stu! I ordered the &#34;black lux&#34; and the color is exquisite! A brown boot overall with a lovely black wash. The photo does NOT do them justice and they were the cheapest color option! Score! I LOVE AMAZON!!!\n",
      "357 Im not one to generally write comments, or reviews but this piece deserves it. I am a Mom of two and I am constantly running around and carrying a million things. This piece is small, looks great and holds everything!\n",
      "358 I wear a 9.5 but could only find these in a 9. They fit fine. I really like these shoes. They are lightweight and very comfortable. I am used to heavier Keen shoes and am curious how these will hold up. I replaced the insoles but I do that for all of my shoes.\n",
      "359 Comfortable, light weight, good hiking shoe. Arrived in good condition and as promised. I'm happy\n",
      "360 Nice shoes. Very light, though. Good for the price.\n",
      "361 Very comfortable shoe. Loved the color, fit and wearability.\n",
      "362 I ordered silver and I rec'd pink fitflops. They do not fit the same as other size 7s I have ordered in the past!\n",
      "363 Love the roxy slip ons! Couldn't be happier with how they look. They tend to be a little wide for my feet, work better in the fall and winter with socks. Also not much for support, but perfect for me to wear to work/school when I'm wanting to wear something other than sneakers. Definitely not something I'd like to wear when I'm on my feet all day though.\n",
      "364 Let me start off by saying that I am a complete novice when it comes to buying shoes based solely for running. I found a recommendation online and made my decision based on that. I'm very pleased with my purchase and I will most likely continue to buy going forward.\n",
      "365 My husband loves these shoes! He lives in them! He will never buy another boot ever again!\n",
      "366 I have wide feet. These are not gonna work for me.\n",
      "367 For a medium width they are way to wide.  They would provide arch support is foot did not move around so loosely in the shoe.\n",
      "368 Perfect fit. The arrive date of my package wasn't until sept 11-25 and I received them faster than that. Very pleased with them.\n",
      "369 This was not my first pair of ASICS shoes.  I keep buying them because they are super comfortable and always fit.\n",
      "370 My son loves them. They were a bit tight for the first few days but a bit of breaking them in and they are good to go\n",
      "371 Super cute. I followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered 2 sizes too large - perfect!\n",
      "372 These were the best shoes for our son, before and definetely when he was learning to walk, they protect his feet in every way, but thin enough for him to feel different surfaces with his toe's in order to learn to walk, and they of course went with everything. love these shoes, and will be ordering more with my second son.\n",
      "373 They are very comfortable and since I'm on my feet all day that is a plus.\n",
      "374 Nice boot Insides are leather also\n",
      "375 Great boots, awesome colour (my favourite shade!) and so durable. I worked in them through rain and mud and they withstood it all! It was even good to hike in up a muddy hill because of the good tread on the bottom. Thank you!\n",
      "376 Pretty comfortable!\n",
      "377 The Naturalizer Women's Fryna Wedge Sandal are beautiful sandals. They are a little snug but being all leather I know they will stretch. I liked these sandals so much I also ordered them in Navy, very nice. I have worn Naturalizer shoes and sandals for quite a while and have always been happy with them. The sandals are leather, well made and comfortable, really couldn't ask for more.\n",
      "378 Cute bag, I have carried several times since I received it. The chain strap makes it different and cute\n",
      "379 These are absolutely adorable and she loves them.\n",
      "380 these are amazing! they don't feel cheap at all! they're very sturdy and look great!\n",
      "381 Really cute! I love that these shoes are stylish, plus they're practical. My 15 month old son can walk around, and play in these without any issues. I personally ordered them a little big, so he could wear them a little bit longer. Fast delivery. Product as described. Very cute! He seems to enjoy wearing these.\n",
      "382 My daughter loves these shoes.  It's all she wears at the hospital.  Even the patients tell her how cute they are.  She wears a size 9 in most shoes, but has found that the 9.5-10works best in Danskos.\n",
      "383 very pleased\n",
      "384 Love these shoes\n",
      "385 Fine\n",
      "386 Satisfied. With  everything  I ordered  no issues  with.  Anything.\n",
      "387 Great walking shoes !\n",
      "388 These were perfect! I was afraid they might be too big for my 3 year old, but they fit great all around! I believe they will still work for another year if not two! Definitely recommend this product!\n",
      "389 Looks great , fit great, this is a excellent shoe. I love Steve Madden shoes. The wife likes them to and that's always a plus.\n",
      "390 I.ve been  a Keen client/user for 10years and as  allways I am very happy with the product. Keep up the good work and the excellent designs..\n",
      "391 Have not worn them for a long period of time.  The most has been 3 hrs and so far no problem.\n",
      "392 Clear fits well<br />Nice product\n",
      "393 Love it\n",
      "394 great shoe but much too heavy for me.\n",
      "395 These shoes are cute and I felt like they fit the way they were supposed to.<br />But as stated in another review the product came missing some rhinestones. As seen in the photos.\n",
      "396 Perfect love them\n",
      "397 Legs and lower back definitely feel a lot better, but the shoe could use more padding in general. Support is great, but after a while it feels like walking on concrete at the ball and heel. It is possible that its because I am heavy.\n",
      "398 WILL BE ORDERING THESE AGAIN:  ONLY WISH THAT THE SIZE I ORDERED CAME IN OTHER COLORS.\n",
      "399 Bought for my two sons and they love them! Better than even the picture , timberlands or as my sons say &#34;timbs&#34; are awesome.\n",
      "400 this was a gift that was given to someone else\n",
      "401 Beautiful loafer.\n",
      "402 Love it!\n",
      "403 great baby shoes\n",
      "404 Love these shoes. I find them very comfortable.\n",
      "405 I had to give them to my daughter since they run large for the size.  Nice slippers but buy a smaller size.\n",
      "406 Better than I thought, turned around and ordered two more pairs.\n",
      "407 love these shoes\n",
      "408 Artsy Classic\n",
      "409 Everything about this flip flop is great!  Keep in mind if these get wet, they may go...slosh...slosh..slosh.  Not a biggie for me.\n",
      "410 A little stiff out of the box but they should break in nicely. I bought these shoes for use in my hospital job. I ScotchGuarded them and  hope that It will keep them white.\n",
      "411 Who knew?  I love these shoes. They're comfortable, they give good support, they're light.  I'd buy them again, if they were offered.\n",
      "412 Great fit, very comfortable and great looking for the asked price. Very very satisfied.\n",
      "413 :o]\n",
      "414 Love these. I always get a set of gel insoles when ever I get a new pair gym shoes.\n",
      "415 Great show for the price\n",
      "416 Super comfortable--a bit flip-floppy for real walking but perfect around house and yard.\n",
      "417 Cheap material and it smells like gasoline. Its pleather and falls apart. I guess you get what you pay for. Also, on the shoe box it says this product can not be sold in California because it says the chemicals in the material may cause cancer. Ive worn them too much to return and threw away the box.\n",
      "418 I waited for these shoes for almost 3 weeks. I was disappointed to see they looked almost nothing like the ones in the picture. The heel isn't 3-4 inches like it says, more like barely 2 inches. The strap is halfway broken. The buckle doesn't fit because the strap was made very horribly. I gave it 2 stars because they got to me before the time I was told. Besides that? Very disappointed.\n",
      "419 Finding the right fit for these shoes can be difficult because they use European sizing. The easiest conversion can be found directly on the Vibram website.<br /><br />That said, these came in properly sized. But getting accustomed to my first pair of Fivefingers natural shoes is taking some time. Ease into them a couple hours per day to avoid fatigue and blisters.\n",
      "420 Overall these are pretty decent around the house lounging shoes hahaha! They fit great and they are surprisingly durable for the price.\n",
      "421 these were new tags attached but smelled sooooo bad like it was in a moldy dirty factory, i recieved then the morning of going to splish splash so i wore them and the insoles kept sliding and unstuck from the shoe and started rolling up on the arch of my foot! I wripped them off n went barefoot the rest of the day\n",
      "422 This is just what I needed. I am happy with it.\n",
      "423 Side of shoe coming apart after 1 month. First time purchasing hush puppies. I would not buy again. I tried to return to company and they would by replace item. Poor customer service. I would not recommend product.\n",
      "424 Terrific!\n",
      "425 Really nice shoes really good price but they are a little too big\n",
      "426 Cute as a fashion accessory.\n",
      "427 Needs buy covr for back n front so wont rub skin off.but once thats done.i loved it more\n",
      "428 The shoes were very comfortable in all other regards, except for being slightly too short, enough to be uncomfortable after a while. I was using thick woolen socks and a I just changed these to normal socks and they fit just fine. Aside from that, everything was good. In the future I would probably have gotten a half a size bigger.\n",
      "429 But it wear nice.\n",
      "430 Love these! Hunted all over for them!\n",
      "431 It creates hot spots on your foot. It's not very confortable. It needs a break in period I guess but it feel bad on the foot. I like that it's light and fits well(size was just right). The lining on the inside is very lumpy so it creates pressure points or hot spots on top of your foot. I had more confortable wolverines in the passed but this one is not up to par  to what I expected. Only time will tell if it will get more confortable.\n",
      "432 Returned for a larger size.  Run small.  Other than that, they were amazingly comfy for being on my feet for 10+ hours.  They are ugly as sin though, be prepared for some stares.\n",
      "433 Great s**t\n",
      "434 Great shoes\n",
      "435 very nice bag.\n",
      "436 Pretty cute. Held up with international traveling over 15 days and 8 plane trips as checked luggage. Still looks new.\n",
      "437 These are awesome, they look cool, make me run fast through the halls, and fix my pronation. Overall awesome. Plus they come in 13s\n",
      "438 They will be perfect once they are stretched out.  The insides are very comfy!\n",
      "439 Didn't last very long. My 11 year old wore the seams out within a few months..\n",
      "440 Same model that I wore out over several years playing golf, so even my 6.5 éee feet will be snug for a while, the shoes will expand enough to be just right within a month or two. Ps:  not expanding. I think they may have been marked wrong. I actually bought a pair from the manufacture as we'll and experiencing same condition. My 9 inch foot compares to a size 6 on international chart but I may need to move up to an 8 to get a comfortable fit.  I need to visit a store that has small sizes.\n",
      "441 Love these sandles and hope they never never change this style or discontinue them. Very sexy looking on the foot. I have several in different colors\n",
      "442 I haven't worn them enough to really know. I still need to get used to how high these platforms are. They are kind of hard to walk in but with enough practice it will become easy. They look amazing and they are very good quality. I like them a lot.\n",
      "443 Beautiful color and style.  I gave them to my daughter.  She loves thems.\n",
      "444 Just as expected\n",
      "445 I owned a pair of these shoes before and they quickly  became my favorite pair of work shoes,they lasted me well over a year. They were so nice I decided to buy 2 pair this time! Well after only 3 months they are starting to fall apart especially around the tip of the toe and the inside heal  area. Not sure why they are so different from the last pair, but once this second pair wears out in a few months I will not be buying another pair.\n",
      "446 Item as described, fit perfect, fast shipping\n",
      "447 very light and comfortable,good shoes. just run as you wish..\n",
      "448 So far...the best work shoes I have ever owned, and until  someone suggested I try this shoe,I have only used the brand I trusted most.<br />To say these are better than Red Wing Worx, is a compliment. As an added bonus ...these are half the price.\n",
      "449 Love them\n",
      "450 Size were too small and they were no quality\n",
      "451 Nice looking shoe.  Comfortable\n",
      "452 I have been looking for a good wide toe box shoe for years.  My toes naturally spread out to the point where my wife says I could fit another toe in between the ones I have.  I had researched different ways to lace up shoes to make them feel wider and it worked for a while until my foot would begin to blow out the sides of the shoes.  now insert the Altra One2.  This is the most comfortable running shoe I have ever worn!!!  I have had Asics, Nike, Addidas, Zoot, etc.  This one takes the win easily.  I was previously trading off running in Nike Free 3.0 and the Zoot Ultra Kiawe Race.  I was getting ready to start a marathon training plan for this season and decided I needed a new pair of shoes.  I bought these based on all the other reviews stating how wide the toe box is and the fact they are zero drop!  First pair i bought was a size 10 as that is what I wore in the Nike Free and Zoot Kiawe Race.  The Altras were a little too small, returned for a 10.5.  PERFECT FIT!  I have done multiple long runs in these shoes including speed and tempo work.  Average weekly miles in these shoes is about 30 miles.  They have been great so far!  I will definitely buy another pair of Altras when these give out.\n",
      "453 they didn't fit well. Love the shoes.\n",
      "454 These are thin and comfortable in my dress shoes! Helping with my plantar fasciitis.\n",
      "455 These shoes were larger than I expected and I should have listened to other buyers.  I reordered a smaller size and they now fit pretty good and look great.  Overall i'm pleased with the comfort and looks.\n",
      "456 comfortable\n",
      "457 Nice sneakers, my son loves them!\n",
      "458 These shoes feel great on my flat feet.  I have a wide forefoot and narrow heel and this shoe works for that too.  I have had sciatic problems and an injured left knee, and I can wear this shoe all day long with comfort.  I spent 3 days walking for hours at a golf tournament and felt I could not have done it without these shoes.  It is the most expensive shoe I have ever bought and it was worth every penny to me.\n",
      "459 These are some of the best shoes I have ever purchased. My close friends all said I was crazy when I told them how much I spent on my new, New Balance shoes, but I am confident with my purchase.<br /><br />I work as a photographer, taking photos all day long for hours on end. Even after spending one of my longest working days (13 hours) on my feet, they did not hurt. I was not in any discomfort whatsoever, and am sure that it was because of how great these shoes are.<br /><br />They may be a bit pricey, considering New Balance doesn't sell anything more expensive, but they are so worth it. If you are looking for a pair of well-made, high-quality shoes, then these are for you.\n",
      "460 Nice looking shoes! Chosen for a trip.\n",
      "461 i sent them back. they were too small for my kid, and though the quality is decent there is no excuse for charging $60 for these silly things. they are flimsy slippers.\n",
      "462 Probably should have gotten a half size smaller, but still a good shoe.\n",
      "463 I wanted a slipper for around the house that wasn't a thong, didn't cover my whole foot, and wasn't fluffy, and these fit the bill. I love these slippers. They're the same kind my grandma used to wear around the house all day. The mesh is great because it lets your feet breathe, which is awesome for those hot summer days. It's lightweight, and the sole is a very dense foam, so it provides some cushion while not feeling flimsy. They also stay on your feet surprisingly well for a slip-on.\n",
      "464 Love, loVE, LOVE them! Perfect with tights, skinny jeans, dresses... You name it, they go with it!\n",
      "465 So much comfort!  I have a wide foot and have been searching for cute wedges for an upcoming vacation.  This is my first pair of UGG's, but they are as comfortable as I would have expected from the brand.\n",
      "466 hiked 20 miles aound Mount Rainer on first wear.. no problems\n",
      "467 Fast Delivery of the shoes.  I love the Saucony brand the comfort and fit of the shoe are get whether you are<br />wearing them for daily wear or for running or jogging.\n",
      "468 Can be dressey or casual\n",
      "469 I have had so many compliments on these sandals! I love them! No, they don't provide much arch support, but I typically do not expect that from a flat sandal. They are quite comfy to wear all day. I am a teacher and have worn them to work, I must say I am impressed!\n",
      "470 These Crocs might be fine but they said child/toddler even on the tag, and they are almost big enough to fit my wife.  Probably not a huge deal to return them in the US, but we are overseas so it is a pretty big pain.\n",
      "471 Love the shoes!\n",
      "472 I love this purse! It is well made and sturdy. It has a lot of space and pockets. The only thing I would change is to have the handles just an inch longer so it can go on your shoulder better or have the extra strap shorter.\n",
      "473 They fit perfectly (size 1)\n",
      "474 Not for wide feet\n",
      "475 The leather is very nice and the interior is as well.  The main zipper looked to be messed up but once I unzipped and rezipped it seems fine; I'm hoping it holds up as the purse is used.  However, the shoulder strap was a big disappointment.  The wrist strap is beautiful like the clutch itself, but the shoulder strap is a tiny strip of that leather on a stiff, bulky black canvas or something, totally too casual a look for dressier look.  (I definitely don't plan to use the shoulder strap and it was the one I really wanted for that.)  If you're looking for a nice clutch or wrist bag, this is very pretty.\n",
      "476 excellent shoe\n",
      "477 My husband loves his new boots!\n",
      "478 Love these heel boots they are so sexy on and easy to put on<br />they are true to size<br />great for thick legs\n",
      "479 Not good qvolity\n",
      "480 The shoe fits really good it my first time ever buying a pair of Nike flyknit\n",
      "481 The on;y problem...they make my feet sweat.\n",
      "482 Great for shoes, leather, saddles,\n",
      "483 This clutch is elegant and look way better than the picture shows. The only complain is that some of the stones are coming out. Would be nice to include some extra stones for replacement.\n",
      "484 Returned too small\n",
      "485 fit small and they look very small\n",
      "486 Good looking shoe and extra padding/foam bottom for a heavy runner.\n",
      "487 Super cute shoes, but they were too small.  The next size up wasn't available but I kept checking back.  When they were avail, the price increase made me mad. So I didn't end up getting them. :-(\n"

      "488 These boots are beautiful and fit perfectly. I bought the size I normally wear in a boot and they are just right. The laces do actually adjust and there is a leather tongue behind them so you can open the front up if you need more room for your calf and there isn't a bunch of skin or stocking showing.\n",
      "489 I now have these in both black and silver and they're just fab!  Great looking and comfortable enough to wear all day long!\n",
      "490 These are really pretty shoes, I ordered them in white and they look really nice, but the toe box was a little too pointy and made my size 11 foot look even longer:(. I still highly recommend them because the are attractive pumps!\n",
      "491 You can't beat these shoes for the price!\n",
      "492 Nice!\n",
      "493 By far best running shoe for those on the husky side. It's has amazing arch support and does not wear down as fast as other shoes. I run about 15 miles a week. Amazing shoes!\n",
      "494 I have owned a pair before and really enjoy them over other flip flops!\n",
      "495 Absolutely adorable with lots of cool blinking lights!  Unfortunately  these run smaller than other Geox shoes of the same size.  Hopefully I can exchange for a larger pair.  They arrived on time and well packaged for shipping.\n",

      "501 Ive hax great experiences with this boot.  I wear them as a combination of daily shoe,  work boot,  and motorcycle boot.  They are comfortable like sneakers and offer the protection i was looking for as a summer/short ride motorcycle boot.  They have lasted for a little over 2 years where i used to go through otger boots in 1 year.  At the end of their life the leather,  stitching, and tread all wore out at the same time.  Maybe a downside for some but i dont care is the black color fades to green as they age (see pic of 2.5 ywar old boot) I went through 2 pair of laces.  I wish this boot was one of their made in the USA boots.  I would be willing to pay more if it was.\n",
      "502 I have had issues with my feet for years. I've spent thousands of dollars on shoes the past 5 years. I was worried about buying shoes at all online, but the price was great and they looked exactly like what I was looking for. I was familiar with the brand and their quality, so that eased my mind a bit. I've tried Clark's and they had no cushion or support. Same with all the other brands, high end or not. These boots are great! They are very comfortable and cushioned. They look really nice. I've gotten a bunch of compliments every time I wear them.\n",
      "503 I've been getting this shoes since iteration 13. They have always been great, and this iteration are a lot lighter than 16 that I had before.\n",

      "508 Love them! Just what I was looking for...thanks\n",
      "509 I LOVE the hoka One Women's Cliftons.  I tried on the Clifton 2s and there is no comparison in width and comfort.  I will have to buy another pair on line before they disappear since Hoka is not replicating this great shoe!!!\n",
      "510 I love it!  Amazing! I want all the colors.\n",
      "511 Very pleased!\n",
      "512 A bit on the short side for an 8.5 but since only for a costume they'll do. I would order at least a half size up though.\n",

      "516 Stylish and functional!\n",
      "517 It is so hard for me to find boots because of my calfs. These boots are amazing, comfy, and most importantly fit my big calfs!! I highly recommend them, especially if you have the same problem as I do!\n",

      "519 Beautiful shoe. Fits very well. The unique clasp took me a second to figure it out. And the silver material of the actual shoe was slightly peeling in one small spot. But I'm not fussing. It's an all around beautiful, comfortable shoe that I can't wait to wear.\n",
      "520 I own several pairs of Skechers sandals and I am giving three stars for two reasons:<br />1. they run a bit large and loose;<br />2. The straps are hard and not that comfortable as those made from fabric martials.<br /><br />I got them at a good price and I am keeping them. I wish they make more of those with fabric material on the straps which stretch and offer more comfort and flexibility.\n",
      "521 They fit let kid sunglasses. The lens where not very clear and scratched easy. Not very comfortable to me at all. I have long eye lashes and they rubbed.\n",
      "522 Nice and comfort\n",
      "523 I have had the classic Blundstones for 15 years and this year I decided to get fancy. I'm really glad I read the other reviews in advance about the sizing: these boots really do have LONG toes because of the shape. Every review recommended that I order a size down.  I did and they fit PERFECTLY.  (My other blunnies are a size 8 US Women's, and I ordered a size 7 USW for this style.)<br /><br />Also, they are wonderful boots but do take time to break in.  For example, if you were to use these for horseback riding and you decide to wear them for the very first time cow sorting for 2 hours you will be sorry.  Start slow.\n",

      "526 I love the look of the snearkers, but they are not very comfortable.  I wore them for spin class, and my feet hurt.  However, they are comfy for walking.  Saucony is an excellent brand of running shoes.  I swear by them; however, this model is not made for exercising.\n",

      "534 Great fit very comfortable\n",
      "535 These are so cute! They fit snuggly, so if you have to wear socks - wear thin ones or stockings. Also it wouldn't hurt to scotch guard them, as the material can easily get dirty from everyday wear. Overall I love them.\n",
      "536 I don't feel that I'm wearing a shoes , light and comfortable.\n",
      "537 Nice looking shoe that fits well. Extremely comfortable.\n",
      "538 Pretty much liked the shoes, but they hurt across the base of my big toe. For this reason, I returned them. They also had a weird tongue set up if you laced the last hole- didn't come up to the top of the laces. My first pair of fitness shoes...maybe they're all like that. They are not made for cushion and support, IMHO.\n",

      "540 Loved it as soon as I saw it and immediately got disappointed when I tried it on )-: like someone else posted, bout a half size too small. so bummed, wish they had it in half sizes or a 12. considered returning and ordering a 9 in men's, but its just not the same since this is a wedge and the men's is just a regular straight flipflop.\n",
      "541 My dog ate my first pair of wedges, they were my favorite pair as well. I could not find them at other shoes stores, checked here and I found them. I wear these wedges to everything, work, church, parties, and everything in between. They are comfortable and easy for me to walk in. Thank you amazon for having them.\n",
      "542 It's too narrow for my girl\n",
      "543 These are really good for the price. They are comfortable and warm. I have bigger calves and these fit me good. I liked them enough to go back and buy them in black!\n",
      "544 I have very narrow feet so these were just fine for me. The heel is perfect for walking long hours\n",
      "545 Great fit and great shoe!\n",
      "546 Somewhat tight in the heel, but otherwise very comfortable.\n",
      "547 I like these boots, didn't fit too big like many other people said.. I'm usually a 7 1/2 and that's what I ordered, and they fit with socks which is what I like.  I think the heel might be a little cheap, but for the price, not bad.\n",
      "548 So many lints!! But my son love them\n",
      "549 I was running out of silver sandals so I decided to go for this beauty. As I know from previous purchases, Walking Cradles makes decent, stylish and comfortable sandals. I was not let down, the sandal fits perfect, looks really pretty, has rich leathery feeling, no straps cutting my toes is an intelligently designed slingback, so you can put them on in seconds and wear them for days on end. Combines well with all my summer dresses, skirts and shorts. May summer never pass :)\n",
      "550 excelente\n",
      "551 Comfortable fit, perfect fit, I love this shoe.\n",
      "552 Love this purse, soft & perfect for every day\n",
      "553 Love these glasses.  So cute and they fit great.\n",
      "554 I have severe plantar fasciitis and require prescriptions meds.  I have not been able to walk normally for 6 months and these shoes plus another Sofft shoe have literally been a god send.  In fact I just bought two more pair and I have 3 other pair of Sofft is another style.  These re fantastic!!!!! I feel as though I can run a marathon. The are almost like birkenstocks but without the severe arch support.  These are a lighter arch support but great.  Buy them - you will not regret it.  Also - you can wear this particular pair with skirts.  LOVE THEM.\n",
      "555 I like it. so comfortable, highly recommend!\n",
      "556 Love it. Big and roomy. It's  fun and I look forward to using it\n",
      "557 Perfect size purse..I absolutely love it!!!\n",
      "558 I tried these on as soon as they arrived. I love them! They fit perfectly and look so cute 😍\n",
      "559 These are really good shoes. They are nice, soft leather with good, grippy, flexible soles. Momo tends to run a little big for my child's feet, so I ordered the 5.5 instead of the 6 and they fit perfectly.\n",
      "560 I have always wanted a pair of yeezy's. I've been homeless for quite sometime now and these were definitely a life changer. The price was a little expensive, and being a homeless man, these were not even an option. I was doing some research at my loval burger king and found out that my dog that meant everything to me,  a Duck Tolling Retriever, went for 3000$. So the next day  I took my dog max to the local breeding parture and they offered a solid 3700$ and I took the deal right away. The next day I bought myself a pair of yeezy's and boy although that dog meant a lot to me, i will never regret this decision. Slipping my foot into the each soul made me feel rich. These shoes helped me lose my virginity and get me an office job at a glass company. These shoes have def. changed my life. Love you Max.\n",
      "561 Great shoe but slightly over-sized and will likely stretch further\n",
      "562 Great quality!!  Extremely light!!!!\n",
      "563 Much comfort  fits great.\n",
      "564 Returned for a larger size\n",

      "568 I love these shoes!  They are so comfortable and are my new favorite sandals to wear.  I've gotten so many compliments on them too!\n",
      "569 Runs very small\n",
      "570 10 points. everything was as expected\n",
      "571 Arch support is ok, but the sole does not have much support. Feels like you are walking barefoot.\n",
      "572 Adorable boots, good for the money...got them as a gift and my sis couldn't be happier!\n",
      "573 It's light and comfortable, and I like it!\n",
      "574 I thought this pair of shoes is so nice....... Love it\n",
      "575 It is larger than expected (or rather longer than expected). It is hard to get into the shoe but once my feet are inside, there are too much space inside it. The top part is flatter than usual, so putting insoles will not work for this. However, i like the style -  it looks unique - rugged and yet with feminine touch. The grey looks darker than expected. My friend saw my shoes and like it so much that she ask me to order one for her too! :)\n",
      "576 I cardiovascular heavy and after 6 workouts these shoes are my favorite....\n",
      "577 happy with my new work boots hopefully in about  a year or so we can purchase a new pair threw amazon\n",
      "578 These shoes are stylish and on trend.  The heel is just right, as I don't feel comfortable in really high heels.\n",
      "579 Good product but the shoe size is rather smaller than the regular size 40\n",
      "580 It arrived in time. Fits great!\n",
      "581 Not the quality I was expecting, but I guess you can't expect much at this very reasonable price. Still, It's lovely, and big enough to hold the contents of my purse. I likely wouldn't buy it again, because of the lower quality, but I like it enough to be happy with my current purchase.\n",
      "582 Great quality just a little snug and feel they will stretch some.\n",
      "583 Great Shoes for walking and running, but I ordered a size up as stated by the company and they were to long.\n",
      "584 Freaking Fantastic!\n",
      "585 After a few bumps in the road, everything worked out and I couldnt be happier. Kudos to Supplier My Shoes for following up with the<br />USPS and rectifying the problem.<br />The shoes are as advertised and I would buy again.\n",
      "586 liked my reeboks and they wear well\n",
      "587 Fast delivery and perfect fit.\n",
      "588 I bought these a little over a year ago primarily for running, but also as a general use pair for driving, fishing, and other outdoor activity.  Look, they're $30, and I'm not buying them for fashion--I'm buying them for utility.  And to be honest, they did exactly what I expected.  They weren't too tight, but the rubber nose and temples kept them snug on my head so that they didn't shake or slip when running (I don't have a wide head).  And the vision was solid.<br /><br />A month or so ago, I was bummed when the right lens cracked a bit while in my carry-on luggage.  Last week, I noticed that JiMarti offered a warranty on breakage, so I sent an email to the company on their website with a screenshot of my Amazon order.  Today, a replacement pair showed up in the mail.  Thank you, JiMarti!  I'm looking forward to many more months of active use.  They were worth every penny I spent on them.\n",

      "594 Awesome shoes, I will buy again.\n",
      "595 What else would you expect from  Clarks desert boots than a perfect fit. When I wrote that they wear comfortably &#34;All day&#34; I did not include the night. I take them off when I'm in bed. :-)\n",

      "601 Most comfortable golf shoe I have ever had.\n",
      "602 The most comfortable shoes I've ever bought\n",
      "603 Loved the shoes- very comfortable. The reason I am leaving one star is because after wearing the shoes 4-5 times the strap broke as I was walking. I live in New York, and thankfully I was on my way home, but still had to walk to the train, get on the train and walk home. I hope a fill refund from bass or Amazon.\n",
      "604 Love!\n",
      "605 The box came smushed\n",
      "606 I love these. I love that they are only suede on the sides so I don't have to be quite so conscious of how I step. They are comfortable and because they are nude can be worn with pretty much anything. They are a bit more of a pinky nude, if you have darker skin at all they might not be the true nude shoe you might be looking for. I really love it though because I am super pale and most nudes look like more of a tan on me. ..\n",
      "607 Bien\n",
      "608 Nice shoes the only problem is the size, these shoes are small so I have to return the item and ask to change from 10 1/2 to 11 1/2 and now they fit ok\n",
      "609 I only wear Acsic's and walk 30 miles or more a week. They have great support.\n",
      "610 To small\n",
      "611 unfortunately didn't match with my requested number.\n",
      "612 Does what they're supposed to do, but a bit bulky for my own taste.\n",
      "613 You can't go wrong with Stride Rite.  I bought this brand for my kids when they were little and now I buy them for my grand kids.  Always great for toddlers with wide feet.  If buying through Amazon, please know the prices vary among vendors AND prices will vary among the sizes within the same vendor as well.  For instance, occasionally I find that a shoe will be one price for a particular size, but then when I go up a half size, it will be cheaper.  If you love Stride Rite like I do, and you buy them through Amazon, I recommend you shop and compare thoroughly.  My daughter-in-law bought a pair through Amazon Prime and then I found the exact same shoe and size on Amazon Prime, but different vendor, for $11 cheaper.  Luckily the more expensive shoes were easily returnable through Amazon, but it just demonstrates you really need to shop thoroughly.\n",
      "614 Fast service, true to size, and comfortable. The only thing I'm disappointed about is the wear on the front shoe looks nothing like the picture. It looks like someone just speared a strait line of a lighter color.\n",
      "615 Beautiful case and great decor! However, my case has a  slight defect so that I cannot close it properly; when this case is closed there is a shift between two parts.\n",
      "616 Great price, quick shipping, great quality.\n",
      "617 Great shoes and a great price👍👍👍\n",
      "618 I love the 1100 series volleyball shoes made by ASICS. I use them for clay court tennis because they fit my foot better than tennis shoes.<br />the toe box it a bit bigger in volleyball shoes....the bottom of the shoe is the same as asics clay court tennis shoes so they do not damage the court surface.<br />Also, I find the price is usually better.\n",
      "619 Good fit. Very light.\n",
      "620 The stitching came loose on the front of the boot midway through the first day of wear. They are attractive looking boots, but the craftsmanship is extremely poor. Couldn't believe boots at this price point held up for less than a day.\n",
      "621 I am usually not a flip flop person but I thought I would give these a try just to wonder around the house and yard in. I actually really like these and am happy I made the purchase. These are more comfortable than many other flip flops I have tried to wear. Would recommend!\n",
      "622 Looks and feels great. Goes well with my suit.\n",
      "623 Quite comfortable although the straps are large even with the buckles.  Luckily they aren't necessary to have tight to wear these sandals.  I wore them for 3 or 4 hours and totally forgot I was wearing new sandals/shoes until my mom asked if they were new.  I showed them off proudly even though my mom's eyes were a bit large even as she said how nice they looked.  LOL  Lots of strappy-ness.  Comfortable even on my 63 year old feet.  Its nice they are flat, no wobbling as you walk.\n",
      "624 The White Cream is perfect for leather shoes!  It goes on easy with a small rag.  It keeps it shine and never looks streaky.  I have<br />used it for years!  It seems to protect my shoes,with other polishes my shoes always cracked after a year.  I give it five stars!\n",
      "625 Really nice flat boot.  Looks good and feels good too.\n",
      "626 very nice booths\n",
      "627 Can't wait to wear these with my distressed jeans!!! :-)\n",

      "638 Soft and comfortable, but my feet often hurt the next day.\n",
      "639 Love it. It's everything it looks like in the picture and more. Has three pockets inside, the largest one has a zipper so you don't lose your change all over. Better quality than I had expected for the price. this is a medium sized purse. I can fit all my good stuff inside without it being too clunky like a tote. Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "640 good item\n",
      "641 Strap shorter than expected\n",
      "642 Been wearing the shoes for a week. They feel great and seem very durable.\n",
      "643 Great court shoe & competitive price!  Leave it to Amazon...\n",
      "644 Despite reviews suggesting that these ran small, I ordered them in a 9, because there were no 9.5s, and I assumed the 10s would be too big. WRONG. My toes hung over the ends of the 9s, they were so small! I returned them and ordered the 10s, which fit perfectly, length wise. I do find that they're a bit loose across the toes, though. Beyond that, these are super comfy and pretty cute, especially for the price.\n",
      "645 Fits great. Been wearing for about 3 months coaching twice a week. Two complaints.  One, laces are crazy long, had to replace with old laces. Two, upper is very plastic, hard to get good feel of ball.  But hey,  they were only $20.\n",
      "646 These are well made and stand up to outdoor use. Comfy in the house as well. The slippers are true to size and are a great deal.\n",
      "647 Awesome fit.\n",
      "648 I love the style, especially since I've been looking for one with a toe loop for a long time. At first the left shoe was a little more snug than the right  (for whatever reason)  but after wearing them twice, they were broken in and perfect. The brown is quite dark just in case that is not what you're looking for, and the buckles work just fine. I got a size 6 and they fit like a glove.\n",
      "649 the only thing wrong with these shoes is they squeek when you walk in them. maybe it is the leather, but they do make a noise. other than that i have gotten many remarks about how others like my shoes and ask me if they are comfortable. yes they are comfortable and sturdy with great arch supports for those of us who are on our feets for long hours.\n",

      "661 It is just as pictured and perfect clutch. It has two chain straps to pick from and is very pretty!\n",
      "662 Shoes are too big overall.\n",
      "663 These run very small.  My son could not even get his foot in.  I held them up to his other new shoes and there was over an inch difference.  These come from China and do not have free returns, so I will donate them.  I'm only giving them 2 stars because they are good looking shoes.\n",
      "664 I wear 11.5 wide in dress shoes, running shoes, cross training shoes, casual shoes and boots.  These were way too narrow and short in 11.5 wide. I'm hesitant to try another size since they were so far off I couldn't even put them on.\n",
      "665 I was really looking for something bigger.  But that is my fault I should have looked at the measurements.  Picture of girl with bag is deceiving\n",
      "666 Bought these for a trip to Costa Rica.  We planned on some excursions like river tubing and hiking.  I was able to wear these from one activity to the next.  They dry quickly, I would say a few hours in the sun or overnight in shady conditions.  My only gripe with them was sand, when sand gets in them its difficult to get it out.  Wearing them in the ocean caused them to fill with sand.  You had to remove the shoes and rinse it really well.  I would not suggest them as beach shoes.  I really like that they don't look like typical water shoes.  I have no issue wearing them with or without socks and they are comfortable all day.  I have wider feet and they fit well.\n",
      "667 Love\n",
      "668 Said to order 1/2 side and they were right.  Fits perfectly.\n",

      "671 I love these shoes, very comfortable.\n",
      "672 This was my second amazon sneaker purchase. Came with original box, new and as described. Checked out the sneakers and it doesn't look or feel fake to me. That would be a hell of a good job if they were fake. Runs true to size. Some people may feel a little rubbing on the pinky toe. A lot of Jordan's come like that. There made to break in over a long period of walking or fit like dress shoes. However, if that bothers you, I would half size up.  Glad to see Amazon have retro Jordan's! The price is a little higher than released. Not to drastic. This is what you pay when you miss the release dates or if its exclusive for a limited time. I still cant believe people paid thousands of dollars for patent leathers back in the days. The cheapest price was like $2,500 for used ones to like $8,000 for new ones.\n",
      "673 The boots were nice, but I returned them due to small fit.\n",
      "674 Well over all it turned out okay, but I wasn't pleased with promptness or the lack of communication. Therefore the 3\n",
      "675 I needed a western boot for a country-western theme party and I was looking for a great price, DONE! The fit was exactly as described in the ad, and this boot looks as pictured. Yes, it is long and pointy in the toe, the expected look of a dress-boot. Because it was such a low price, I half-expected trouble with the fit and with the quality, but both were top-notch. I am pleased with this purchase.\n",
      "676 I loved this shoes and I hope purchase but the shipping it's very expensive, I would like to  make the purchase free . I  will be grateful to you 😚\n",
      "677 Perfect for Golf beginner.\n",
      "678 These are the 6th or 7th Asic Gels I've owned....if you have a wide foot make sure to get the wide.  Otherwise these are great all around shoes.\n",
      "679 One of the best shoes I have ever worn.  I do wish they had just a little thicker  insole but that is probably just me. &#34;This is how I felt when I bout this shoe to the point I bought another pair. These fabric shoes is week and in one month they developed a hole in them so know my other pair may have to be house shoes. I really had high hopes for this model.\n",
      "680 Shoes ran very small....should order a full size or size and a half larger\n",

      "690 Love the bottle opener!\n",
      "691 Really cute little purse, looks just like the image in person. There is something about it that makes it look just a little bit lunch-boxy (although it's too narrow to be used for that really), but it's really super cute for anyone of any age I think.\n",
      "692 I cannot possibly be the only one who's getting tired of the &#34;hand stitched&#34; advertisement that comes with Born shoes. I own 12 pairs of Born sandals and every one of them after about 3 months has the same problem - the bottom sole separates from the insole. Yes they both have stitching but are not stitched together but glued. If they were not so comfortable I would have given up a long time ago; but due to foot problems Born shoes are the only ones I can wear. Please Born.....at least use a glue that lasts!!!\n",
      "693 The silver detail on the heel is cool but unfortunately that's all that I can say that is positive. The shoes are extremely tight and I can't wear them. The material of the shoe is sort of quilted and it doesn't have a nice finish. I would NOT recommend these shoes to anyone.\n",
      "694 I bought an evening back that had a long gold shoulder strap, not, fan of all chain straps and found this one that works perfect.  It sits at the perfect length under my arm...\n",
      "695 Firmer than expected.\n",
      "696 I needed a 20 slot wallet I am pleased to find one at this price. That being said, I would have gladly paid more for one of better quality overall.\n",
      "697 These are perfect! Very groovy!\n",
      "698 These shoes are perfect! So perfect I'm buying another pair today. I'm a size 7. It fits like a glove. It runs a bit small but I'm sure after a few wears it will fit as it should. Very happy!\n",
      "699 These I bought for my daughter. She Has told me that they are the nicest sunglasses she has had. States the make things outside on bright days much clearer and has no eye strain. VERY HAPPY\n",
      "700 It is ok!\n",
      "701 These are my favorite boots!\n",
      "702 Only reason for giving less than 5 stars is that they need to Hi-Light that these son glasses have a very large bridge and will not fit most people.  Black fly's are an excellent manufacturer of shades though.\n",
      "703 These run very small \u001a\n",
      "704 I haven't worn these boots yet, but tried them on and they fit; I know nine west shoes/boots run a little small so I ordered a 9.5 instead of my normal size 9. They are slippery so I  added  the anti-slip pads on the bottom of them.\n",
      "705 Good boots not non slip through. For the price they are surprisingly comfortable\n",
      "706 They feel like you're walking on pillows. They are a bit warm to wear in this heat wave but all speakers are. Looking forward to wearing on my daily mile when it cools down.\n",
      "707 Cheaply made\n",
      "708 Good fitted shoe. Wears well.\n",
      "709 Perfect fit, very comfortable, great price. No complains here.\n",
      "710 The shoe was too small, returned and havent replaced it with a larger size. Cant say much about the shoe since she didnt didnt fit in it, but she seemed to really like the style and it was very light weight.\n",
      "711 I have several pairs of Climacool running shoes so I had to try their golf shoes. They are light and breathable. I like them!\n",
      "712 My daughter really liked the shoes and she wears them all day, every day!\n",
      "713 Ever since I broke my foot 3 yeas ago I have needed supports in my shoes to be able to walk and stand comfortably. I started buying Crocs to use for around the house and to run errands. They were ideal for me right from the start. They provide perfect support for both my now healed foot and my other foot.  I also wanted some Crocs that didn't look like the famous original Crocs.  This design is ideal for me. It looks like a regular canvas shoe but with the famous support and feel of original crocs.\n",
      "714 This is my second pair of these shoes.  On e of the most comfortable and longest wearing shoes I have owned. The new pair feels slightly larger than my original pair, but still are satisfactory.\n",
      "715 When I first tried them on, they felt like I might get a blister from rubbing in certain areas.. however no blister ever formed and they basically molded to my feet. I have flat feet and they are great.\n",
      "716 Loved it when I first got it. Has lots of room and is super cute but the stitching came apart and I  couldn't use it after like a month.\n",
      "717 I have a number of pairs of reef sandals.  The strap on these is not as soft as some of the other models.\n",
      "718 I absolutely love these shoes! I wore them standing/walking 16-hours a day and they are truly comfortable. I only gave the product a three star rating because after 6-9 months of wearing them the insoles began to slip up towards the heel making them uncomfortable/unwearable. I may have wore them down quickly and wished they lasted longer.\n",
      "719 To tight, sent them back\n",
      "720 This is my second time buying these shoes. Very comfortable and goes with just about anything. They can be casual or dressy.\n",
      "721 They are great! Fits as expected and look brand new:)\n",
      "722 great shoes, very happy with them!\n",
      "723 cute shoe but too narrow for my sons feet.  If your child has chubby or wide feet, good luck getting them to fit.  I even bought a half size bigger so he would have some room to grow into them.\n",
      "724 These boots are amazing! They're perfect for the fall season!\n",
      "725 Comfortable and true to size.\n",
      "726 bastante bueno.\n",
      "727 Very comfortable love this shoes\n",
      "728 Love it\n",
      "729 I would give them 5 stars but they are just too narrow and they don't make cycling shoes wide.  I bought them a little big and they  feel great.\n",
      "730 Fits extremely well, has a very comfortable feel. I turned around and bought a backup. The manufacture always change style.\n",
      "731 Have not worn the boots yet.  But did try on to see if they fit with thick socks, as they did.  I ordered a size-up so I could wear the boots with socks.<br />I was surprised the boots were matt leather since I was expecting shiny leather, however I am sure after a few polishings they will look more weathered.  I have high arches and bunions so find boots/shoes hard to fit me.  However, these boots seem really comfortable.  I will wear them in the fall when the weather gets cooler.\n",
      "732 I love my boot\n",
      "733 Not as shinny as the picture and a little snug, but not a bad value at the price\n",
      "734 Great product!  Arrived on time\n",
      "735 They were cheap, but made poorly. They rub my feet at the seams,  and the vinyl has a rubbery feel.\n",
      "736 I bought this to replace my failing Croakies ARC wire cord and it works much better. The ball at the end of the strap allows this to adjust the length of the strap as well as act as a weight for the strap to rest against the back of my neck. Note that these will only work with small and thin frames.\n",
      "737 Fantastic pair of shoes! Will wear them at least a year if not more!\n",
      "738 They aren't sneakers but these balls help the ones you own smell good. I also use them in my boat shoes.\n",
      "739 I love these flips.  I only buy this brand.  They do fall apart after some use (maybe 6 months) but I wear everyday. So I buy more.  Cute design and very comfortable.\n",
      "740 Smelt sooo weird\n",
      "741 Great shoe I love them there suede really nice and they came 3 days early thanks amazon\n",
      "742 The shoe is long and narrow, so it was not a good fit. It seems well built, but I retuned it because it was just not comfortable.\n",
      "743 I receive compliments of these when worn, but find I don't reach for them very often, because they are quite wide. I have always worn an average width. They aren't unwearable, but if you don't like a wider shoe, skip these.\n",
      "744 My husband loves theses slip on shoes!  Very comfortable Crocs.\n",
      "745 3 stars as of now.  There a little tight. Also the color is wrong. Or I might have ordered the wrong ones.  But I can't give a full review.  Until I wear them\n",
      "746 Vertico sandals are very comfortable to wear. I hope to use these for many years!\n",
      "747 These slippers hurt my feet so bad but I have plantar facitis in both feet lord my  arches feel like knives are stabbing me when I put them on pain and more pain. I got these shoes cause I have flat feet .they are hard as h--.run don't buy these shoes\n",
      "748 Niece loved\n",
      "749 The shoe just did not look good on my feet. Looked very flat on the instep. However, overall it's a really cute shoe, the fit was good, possibly a bit wide for my slighlty narrow foot. I am a 10-10.5, often need an 11 in closed toe, and the 11 was correct for me. I think it would look cuter on a wider shorter foot. Seemed to have good support and cushioning.\n",
      "750 The look of the shoe is a solid, clean look.  I like that a lot.  They are comfy, cushy, and light just like the old Free Run 2's.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for the same arch support you got in the original 2.0's, don't buy these shoes.  I have been on a mission to find a pair like the original Free Run 2's because my old ones are super worn out and the new 5.0's have horrible arch support.  I thought and hoped I'd found the right shoes here, but I didn't.<br /><br />If you don't have high arches these might be great shoes for you because the support in these 2's is still better than the 5.0's.  However, if you ARE like me and you have high arches, I don't recommend these shoes.  The support is insufficient and you will probably hurt your shins or your feet (depending on how you step).\n",
      "751 OHHH my new favorite flip flop ever!! Just ripped open my package and put on my new flip flops and don't want to take them off! They are literally the most comfortable flip flops I have ever had, more comfortable than reefs and fit flops.  They are cushy, and soft and don't rub anywhere like others do.  Size fits perfectly.  I love the logo detailing on the inside of the straps too.   Can't wait to get another pair.\n",
      "752 Very, very, pleased with this footware, received many compliments\n",
      "753 I'm on my feet at work up to 11 hours a day. Before I got these shoes my feet ant legs and back were killing me at the end of the day.  Now at the end of the day I'm feeling good and not having any pain. Thank you Nunn Bush!\n",
      "754 We are asolo die hards!last pair lasted 9 years, we hike at least once a month if not 4 times, averaging 10-40 miles a month! But like all shoes, your foot will know if the size and make and shape is meant for you. Happy trails!\n",
      "755 Works great to keep the bright headlights muted.\n",
      "756 Such a classy looking shoe I love them.  Wore them to my daughters wedding, couldn't believe I actually had them on for six hours and feet felt great.\n",
      "757 I love Reef flip flops and these are the most comfortable I've had from them yet.\n",
      "758 Nice boots. Different from what i`m used to, but liking them a lot. would probably buy another pair in the future.\n",
      "759 Love the shoes!  Have had them for 2 winters now and they are still in great shape.\n",
      "760 I know this are supposed to be dance shoes but I used them to throw on my track and field team. I throw shot-put and discus. it supported my foot perfectly with throughout all of my different throws. if you're a thrower and don't want to pay for super expensive shoes these are great especially if you use a south African throw for discus. if you looking for a dance shoe I would also recommend these as I do actually use the for my dance class at the gym. the only problem is that they are a little too big and you don't have much time to exchange them. my where delivered a few days late so i was unable to exchange them for the right size so if you are going to buy these buy half a size smaller. I wear am 8 but I should have bought a 7.5.\n",
      "761 Very Happy with the new Gel-Kayano 22's.  Like the 21's, these are very comfortably cushioned at the heel and fore foot.  The toe-box is snug and the heel counter provides great support.  I am a mid-foot runner and these allow and guide you to stay in line and I don't notice the high 12 mm toe drop, it actually feels lower that that, which is a good thing for me.  At 10.9 ounces the shoe feels light and great for my tempo runs.  I'm training for a marathon in November '15 and I'm happy these came out for me to train in and use for the race.  I've already logged 100+ miles on these Kayano 22's and so far it's been very durable.  I've also ran in the rain in them and they have pretty good traction.  I'm definitely going to buy 2 or more pairs as I love these shoes!  Everything I expected in the shoes from Asics!\n",
      "762 Although they are very stiff at first (to be expected with a wooden sole) these are the only shoes that I can wear standing for about 5 hours without my feet hurting.\n",
      "763 Fits well, no toe crack peepage which I hate! No tread though, can be slippery on certain floors\n",
      "764 I was so nervous to order shoes from amazon but i wasnt disappointed at all. I wear NB all the time especially for work. I especially love the 515 style for yhe comfort and style. I absolutely LOVE these shoes snd the color! NOTE: The blue is actually brighter than pictured but that's even better. Overall im pleased with the comfort style and shipping speed and will order again soon.\n",
      "765 Pretty cute for relatively cheap shoes. A little taller than expected, but I'm 4'10&#34; so it's tough for little girls.\n",
      "766 Love them!!!!!! I absolutely love them, really cute and comfortable.\n",
      "767 excellent\n",
      "768 Perfect fit, size, color, clarity, weight, hold, etc.  Want 10 more pair.  Absolutely love these!!!  I have a medium size head, 6'3, 190, thin/athletic build.  Baseball cap size 7 1/4 I think....\n",
      "769 Excellent product. I love it. Recommended.\n",
      "770 Great out if the box. Perfect fit, very comfortable, good traction. I live  Colorado and I love these!\n",
      "771 As for comfort these shoes are fantastic. However I question how long they'll last since after wearing them for just one day then left shoe started coming apart where there outsole is attached to the toe. I would be way more bothered had I paid full price but since this item was discounted and I'm pretty sure no longer in production, I guess I can only complain a little. Very comfortable and I'll buy new balance again, just not the minimus.\n",
      "772 Really nice shoes, lightweight and they fit my son great.  No complaints and he seems to like them a lot.\n",
      "773 Love Clark's shoes.\n",
      "774 This product was purchased to use in gym showers and it is comfortable for that purpose.  Personally needing much more support for long term comfort, my go to slipper is Fit Flops, also available on amazon.  For the general public I think the support would be good.  Having tried on Croc slippers in the stores, I note they vary greatly in the height of the arch, the height of the heel and overall comfort.\n",
      "775 got these for my boyfriend who does construction and he said they are very comfy.\n",
      "776 These were an adorable shoe; however, they run quite small. I typically wear a 7, but I opted to order a 7.5 as I own another pair of Me Too shoes in that size. The 7.5 was far too small in the toe. I'm not sure an 8.0 would have been large enough. Too bad! Very cute. Size up!\n",
      "777 Super comfortable.  Have ran 4.5 miles yesterday and felt great.  Wanted the wide toe box and mesh sides due to bunions. :(<br />These are going to work perfectly.\n",
      "778 Love these shoes.  They look great, feel great and fit just as expected!\n",
      "779 These were for my granddaughter and she's the one that loves and wears them a lot.\n",
      "780 Very comfortable shoes! Only wish I could get them in the nude color!!\n",
      "781 Really nice sandal! I might be happier if the sole were a bit more cushioned, but I'm not going to quibble. It is cushioned, and well supported, and very comfortable, and what I was looking for.<br />Be aware: Although it does have three adjustable velcro-closure straps, two of the straps are redundant for non-adjustable straps in the same places (the heel strap and the toe strap). Usually I stay away from sandals with non-adjustable straps, because of the width of my feet, but these straps give very ample room in the 3E size -- the ankle strap bit more so than the toe strap..[[ASIN:B00ED7JX1S Propet Men's Anderson Sandal,Black/Grey,13 3E US]]\n",
      "782 Small\n",
      "783 Exactly what I was looking for - right size and full zipper on top to close.  Needed something to carry my extra change of clothes etc for flight and wanted something that would stuff under the seat but not let everything fall out.\n",
      "784 My twin toddlers have feet that are more narrow than most, so it's usually a struggle to find shoes that aren't too wide. These fit the width of their feet perfectly and are lightweight. These are also very cute shoes and nicely priced!! Very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "785 i like it! it is my size, it is comfortable for me, and it is look very good! I am satisfied with my order!\n",
      "786 Good insoles with lots of arch support.  Normally I don't wear shoes for a long period of time as I am retired so I can't say how comfortable they would be if worn all day.  From my experience I would say that they would be better than no arch support.\n",
      "787 Best shoes ever\n",
      "788 nice\n",
      "789 Puma is my favourite brand and these sneakers from Puma is no exception.....just loving it\n",

      "794 Love Carlos!\n",
      "795 These run small order a size up\n",
      "796 I have always loved these shoes. No one in their right mind would SUE because they didn't lose weight wearing them. They help my calves tremendously. I am hard on shoes & these will last me to the end of May. I am a Custodian & I will always buy Skechers as long as they are available & I can afford them! Thank you so much for having them ready & &#34;waiting&#34; for me!!! Love you Amazon!  Barb Z.\n",
      "797 I have purchased this sandal b4.  Excellent support and comfort.  Great arch support.\n",
      "798 Thank you. Fun shoe\n",
      "799 If you have foot problems these are the best flip flops out there.  And the shoes by this company are great too!<br />I've had my fit flops since July and just three days ago they broke, the strap between the toes.  I just call The Gear Coop and left them a message.  I ask for a replacement pair since I've only had them less than 5 months.  I wear them everyday because they are the most comfortable shoes I own!\n",
      "800 Wonderful quality.  I purchased 2 of these elastic straps to add additional elastic to my daughter's pointe shoes for ballet.  They provided the needed support.  They weren't exactly the same color as the elastic on the Bloch pointe shoes that we purchased, but they were very close.  They were shipped the same day and arrived very quickly.\n",
      "801 Too small.  About 1/2 size. No support. Daughter liked.\n",
      "802 I love this purse. It looks smaller in the pictures.. it pretty big, overall great purchase and great price.\n",
      "803 these nb shoes are incredibly comfortable and well sized. i worked on my feet all day indoors on cement today and my feet felt great, never got that soreness in my lower legs/knees or tightness in quads like i do when on my feet for 6 to 8 hours.<br />the memory top insert is the first thing you feel when slipping these on. it feels like youre sliding your feet into a glove.<br />wow, and for the $ these were the best shoe pickup ive ever had. (i ordered a 10 and fit perfect.)<br /><br />i recommend these to a anyone doing a variety of activities throughout a day.<br />so comfortable\n",
      "804 Ordered in narrow and fit perfectly.  grasshoppers have been around for a long time and I can always depend on them fitting great and being comfortable from the first time I wear them.  It is difficult to find arrow shoes now days, but you can always find narrow Grasshoppers.  Thank goodness.  great everyday, comfortable shoe!\n",
      "805 Changed colors and shoes no longer match.  Look at the photos.  One is grey while one is brown-ish... I've hand washed them and it hasn't helped.  Looks like they used a different material on the front.  Fits great.\n",
      "806 good purchase for a great price!!!\n",
      "807 Glad to find these shoestrings.  A bit expensive, but shipping and handling do that, I guess.\n",
      "808 Tight around the toes but loose at heel. Not very comfortable.\n",
      "809 Bought these shoes to wear with my Dickens character outfit as they are as close to the time period shoes I could find I really wasnt expecting them to be so comfortable\n",

      "815 Super cute on my daughter! She loves them!\n",
      "816 I love the Original SWAT Metro boots, they are hands down the most comfortable boots on the market right out of the box. I bought two pairs to rotate every other day so that they don't wear as quickly. I've used boots from 5.11, Magnum, Bates, Thorogood, Danner, Converse, Oakley and Under Armour but for comfort Original SWAT is the winner. Even though they are comfortable after one year of daily use (with rotation) the sole is starting to separate from the boot at the heel on both pairs. I suppose that 6 months is about the average lifespan of most boots where the sole is glued to the boot but I did expect that they would last longer because I rotated both pairs every other day. I had a similar problem with the Original Swat Chase boots after about the same amount of time. I tried the Winx2 boots but they were uncomfortable and not even close to the metro comfort wise. If you are ok with replacing your boots every 6 months then these are great, if not I'd go with a boot that can be re-soled.<br /><br />*** Update 11/26/15 ***<br />Recently the side zipper broke on one of my pairs during my shift rendering the boot useless. The other pair is still functional but one boot has developed a squeak even when walking on non-smooth surfaces. Though I love the comfort of these boots, I won't be purchasing side zip boots anymore and may consider a different brand as replacing boots every 6 months gets old, and expensive.\n",
      "817 Great, comfortable shoe!\n",
      "818 I recomend all Birkenstock shoes.\n",
      "819 Wrong color so I returned it\n",
      "820 Very nicely made and pretty comfortable to wear too. Will buy again soon!\n",
      "821 Nice product.  Sizes run on the small side. I normally wear a US size 11 and I had to exchange for a size 12.\n",
      "822 I am sending this bag back. It is much smaller than described on the site. I can fit a 70 sheet notebook in here, and that's it. It is definitely not functional for work unless all you need to carry around is a notebook and a pen.\n",
      "823 Shipping was fast... runs big my baby is 6 months with big feet her feet is 4.5' so I ordered 0-6 months and fits perfect with a lil room to grow... I ordered in beige they look so cute on my baby\n",
      "824 My second pair and I will definitely be buying a 3rd! Excellent shoe, washable, and comfortable. My first pair has lasted one year so far and still going strong.\n",
      "825 I just got my boots so haven't tried them out in winter weather yet.  I have very wide feet and was also concerned about the fit around the leg/calf.  I usually wear 7-1/2 to 8, so to accommodate a heavy sock, I ordered 8.5 WW.  The fit is fine, in the leg and foot length,  but beware, as mentioned in another review, the toe area tends to be a bit narrow, even with a WW boot size.  I'm sure they'll be fine if I wear a thinner sock as they are a very well insulated boot so warmth should not be an issue.\n",
      "826 Love it very nice came early\n",
      "827 Comfy shoe used for walking several miles per day for exercise.  Love the gel in the ball of the foot and the rear--not many shoes have gel in the front.  Replaced the GT-2000 with these to try and so far am happy with them.  Had to bump up 1/2 a size from the GT-2000, so they feel slightly large, but not uncomfortable.\n",
      "828 He liked the shoes but he said they were too tight at the toes. I am going to order a size bigger.\n",
      "829 Great Style.\n",
      "830 They arrived fast & were beautiful!  I bought them as a gift and she loved them. Now I want a pair for me! :-)\n",
      "831 These shoes are legit they look nice and will fit well with any pair of shoes you have. Get them before they sell out!\n",
      "832 My second pair of Meleen Crocs...so comfortable...love them!\n",
      "833 The shoes are comfortable.\n",
      "834 Bought a half size bigger since they run small and they fit great. Good price for Junior volleyball shoes which are so hard to find. Very satisfied.\n",
      "835 I've purchased at least 3 pairs of Pedipeds per year for the last 7 years. My daughter loves the fit and the quality has been outstanding until now. She wore the Bailey model last year, but this year I purchased the Anna model for her school uniform shoe. After 1 week ( 5 wears), my 2nd grader's shoes were peeled badly. She did not touch them or peel them; she didn't even notice until I showed her. But the material is peeled all the way off the first third of the show and the shoe looks ratty. Extremely disappointing.\n",
      "836 This was my first RYKA. Purchased one more last week. And contemplating another! They fit me better than the lavishly priced Nike/Pumas..\n",
      "837 nice shoes\n",
      "838 Arrived as expected\n",
      "839 I have wide feet and I'm also 5ft 10&quot; so finding shoes that fit are always a challenge. Nine West is one of the few good brands that carries a 10.5 which is my actual size. Most brands go from 10 to 11 - size 11 isn't a perfect fit for me (only works if the brand runs small). I love these shoes! Wore them for a 10hr day and got so many compliments and they were so comfortable. Definitely a great buy!\n",
      "840 I'm very satisfied with my new shoes. However, I am more impressed on how easy the return process was. I really like the fact that I received my new shoes without having to wait until you received my previous ones.\n",
      "841 Very narrow sandals even though i order bigger size than the size chart advice me . The sandals straps are hard , there are not flexible with your feet motion or movement . The front is really narrow and it an give pain in the sides bones of your feet . I don not recommend this sandals for wide feet people . I test them in wet floor and they are really slippery you could fall .   If any one knows a sandals brand that have wide size please let me know thank you\n",
      "842 Can't wear with pants tucked in because I have a wide calf but other than that they are great boots. Wore them today to work and it made tromping through the rain pleasurable.\n",
      "843 These sandals felt good right away. The strap over my toes started to annoy my<br />foot a bit after wearing them 4-5 hours. I like them a lot though.\n",
      "844 Very nice bag. Better tgan i expected.\n",
      "845 I had to return the original pair as too small but I ordered half size bigger\n",

      "851 my boy loves them!\n",
      "852 I'm used to wearing very minimal Merrell barefoot shoes, so I was surprised by how large these Sketchers make my feet look!  The flexible sole is what sold me on them, over other nursing shoes, such as clog styles.  The flexible sole is comfortable; the memory foam insoles are very comfortable and are removable.  The non-fabric upper is appropriate for the medical field.  Overall these shoes work great.  I have high arches and plan to add an arch cookie for when I have to spend many hours on my feet.  My only complaint is that the material listing is misleading: it should not mention the word &#34;leather&#34;, as there is no leather - &#34;man-made&#34; or &#34;synthetic&#34; is all they should specify!  I thought they meant the upper had both synthetic and leather pieces.  I would definitely recommend these to people who need white non-fabric work shoes.\n",
      "853 I work on concrete surfaces from 8 - 10 hours every day. These shoes are extremely comfortable and fit well.\n",
      "854 Excellent!\n",

      "856 I spite of the fact that the package was well protected, there was a hairline scratch, which I debated whether or not to exchange or return.  A little disappointed that it was also smaller than displayed.\n",
      "857 I like the shoes a lot, very comfortable - that said, TAKE THE ADVICE OF THE OTHER POSTERS!  I wear a 9.5 in Foot Joy shoes...thankfully I went to 10.5 in these at the advice of others, and they fit great.  MAYBE I could have gotten 10s, but 9.5 would have been way small.  So, I don't know if it's Foot Joy or Puma with the error, but use this as your guide if you're coming from FJs.  These shoes are very comfortable for sure!\n",
      "858 Ive done my research and these boots are hard core great. If I could only find them in women friendly sizes? I cant find them in Womens, (HELCOR) so im trying to match my size up with mens sizing. Im a solid 8in wmns, and Tims run big so unfortunately im returning these. Boo. I really hope these find a home since they are great for snow, mud/water, scuff and rough workwear, and stylish! The HELCOR material these Timberlands are made of are seriously unbreakable. So you don't even have to baby your boots and worry about getting them messed up. They can take care of themselves, and they will take good care of your feet!\n",

      "870 I have been wearing this exact same brand and size for years. My other pair was looking pretty shoddy so I ordered another pair. This pair runs small and is very uncomfortable, I have tried &#34;breaking them in&#34;, but sadly, they are simply too small. Again, I have an identical pair that fits perfectly, so not sure what has happened...regardless, I now have a pair of $59 shoes that I cannot wear :(\n",
      "871 Cute shoes! Fit nicely for a petite 9 year old girl.\n",
      "872 They look great.  No binding around the ankles.  Very comfortable.  Would've been nice to have some arch support with the platform because the shoes do not bend as you walk, the soles don't flex, however the footbed is very soft.  As I write this I'm a bit indecisive about keeping them for the no-flexibility reason...but the shoes look so-oooo good and the camel color is awesome!  I am so torn...\n",
      "873 The inside liner keeps coming loose s d bunched up under the foot.\n",
      "874 Love these Zumba shoes! Can move around without pain in my feet. Not recommended for walking.\n",
      "875 Very comfortable shoe, I can wear it all day at work. The shoe is soft, and it does not stretch out throughout the day.\n",
      "876 Love them! True to size. Arrived quicker than expected.\n",
      "877 I've been waiting to buy these boots for weeks, and it stinks that they were way too small. I even went up a half size, but color and style are pictured well.\n",
      "878 Super cute but very narrow!\n",
      "879 Love this! I have wide flat feet and bunions, even though I typicall wear 7 1/2 I ordered a size 7 because Vionic reduces over-probation, and naturally realigns your feet over wear. It fits perfectly, and since I love the other pairs so much, I've order a few other vionic slippers, wedges, and sandals.\n",
      "880 Nice\n",
      "881 Love this shoe. And the seller was great.\n",
      "882 My feet are currently enjoying these shoes, every day for a week now. These are my everyday, in and out shoes for puttering, playing with the dog, etc.  I ordered two sizes, the usual half size up based on feedback in reviews, and my regular size. I have to return the regular size, too short. The fleece lining is thick, certainly takes up room, but after a week I can say the half size up is perfect. Suede stretches, the fleece compacts, so far so good.  Arch support is decent, weight is good, soles very nice. I am pleased with these. They are cute, too.\n",
      "883 I have always been happy with this shoe. They last forever. Also very comfortable .\n",
      "884 Gorgeous! Heel is not too high. Quite comfy (but different from regular shoes)\n",
      "885 Great value.\n",
      "886 do not it as well as other skecher scandal that I purchased.\n",
      "887 Love, love, love it!  The leather is super soft.  2 main compartments really help me to organize all the junk I carry around with me.  So glad I bought this.  Would buy a second in a heartbeat!\n",
      "888 I've been looking for comfortable shoes for some time. The term &#34;relaxed fit&#34; for these shoes is very appropriate. They aren't loose and fit very comfortably; regular width shoes can often be uncomfortable for people with arthritis. They are light, and handle hot temperatures well (I live where summer temps are often above 100 F). I recommend these highly if you have had difficulty with the usual regular width shoes.\n",
      "889 beautifull color, i really fall in love, but it is too small, i really dessappoint\n",
      "890 These are as close to going bare foot as you can get and still be allowed into public places; and I can walk all day in them without any foot pain at all.\n",
      "891 My daughter normally wears AFO's and is unable to stand or walk without them. I was looking for something for her to wear around the house, for short distances, without needing to wear all the AFO gear. Unfortunately for her, the memo sandals still didn't give her little ankle the support she needs to feel comfortable walking. They are so so cute. High quality shoes. I'm sad they didn't work for us\n",
      "892 It is for a cosplay of mine and it is exactly what I was looking for, Thank you.\n",
      "893 These were very chic as expected. Love them!\n",
      "894 It is ok. Not the best quality. The pros are that it is light and comfortable but don't expect to walk in it for hours.\n",
      "895 i like them.\n",
      "896 I love these shoes and I own three pairs.  HOWEVER, two out of three pairs in less than one season have started to fall apart.  It's almost like they went short on the amount that was tucked under and sewed in as the cloth on the footbed starts to pull away become untucked.  You also definitely do not want to come in contact with any water, as the falling apart process will accelerate.\n",
      "897 Love them!\n",
      "898 Just right for a travel bag.\n",
      "899 It looked ok, but the zipper always got stuck and the lining behind the card slots came out. Waste of money.\n",
      "900 I´m very dissatisfy with this shoes, it´s running TOO NARROW on fingers, I´m been buying cole haan for the 19th last years, and this is the first pair with this problem for me, it´s impossible to use.\n",
      "901 They are cute.  I gave them to my daughter because they are too small.  They are wide as well.  My daughter and I have narrow feet.  They are comfortable.  For somebody with a wide foot, I would say order a size up and you could walk around Disneyland all day.\n",
      "902 I love this bag although mine differs from the current image!<br />Amazing quality in every way!\n",
      "903 My daughter loved these!\n",
      "904 The shoes look great but they have a very strong smell of rubber/faux leather. People could smell it from a distance. It smells &#34;cheap&#34; :-(\n",
      "905 Too big for my face...\n",
      "906 PRO: These shoes are super cute. They look great, and seem to match with everything. As with most Tom's shoes they are generally very comfortable.<br /><br />CON: The picture of these were green. They're not. They are beige. I looked it up and since no green version of this shoe exists, I kept it. However hopefully others realize when they are buying not to trust the picture.<br /><br />CON: I have semi-wide feet and they are a bit tight on the sides and pinch a little. If you have slender feet, they would probably be the most comfortable shoes ever, however if you have slightly wider feet, just be prepared they will pinch. If you have wide feet? I wouldn't consider these shoes at all, otherwise you would have very angry feet after wearing them.\n",
      "907 Very comfy!! Great shoe! I can wear these all day with no pain!\n",
      "908 I would buy again\n",
      "909 Love at first sight!!! I'm a Gucci girl and these are perfect. My sister and I rock them!!\n",
      "910 The only downside to these super cute shoes is wearing them in wet weather. The sole of the shoe becomes very slick and your foot will slide out so I don't recommend wearing them in the rain or if you know it will be raining. Otherwise, I love them and get a lot of compliments.\n",
      "911 Works great for a floor installer who rips apart the toes on all work shoes until these\n",
      "912 Very comfortable shoe. My only problem is I really need a larger toe box due to the orthotic I need to wear but the shoe itself is great !  It's supportive and very light weight.\n",
      "913 Their great\n",
      "914 I order size 6, but they run too large. Its the worse purchase i ever done in my history.\n",
      "915 I have had another pair of Merrell converible sandals for years and loved them but they are clunky looking.  These have the same comfort but are far more attractive.\n",
      "916 These boots are comfy and cool , love the material, super soft.\n",
      "917 first day it is broken. I do not like it\n",
      "918 Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned!!\n",
      "919 Quality is very low, I just took one look and they were back in the box being shipped back. Sorry but cheap material on my feet is not something I can handle.\n",
      "920 laces dig into the top of my foot, I am adding a piece of leather to the underside or replacing the laces with soft ones. I think i can dance in them.\n",
      "921 loved them and have actually worn them out and need to try to find another pair.\n",
      "922 I bought these slippers in a size Medium from another retailer and they were a bit shorter in the toe than I expected.  I normally wear an 8 to 8.5 shoe.  That said, they're made very well - durable leather suede with thick wool shearing throughout the inside (very soft - not itchy at all).  I gave the Medium's to my daughter who pretty much claimed them when I discovered they were too short in the toes for my feet, and she rarely wants to have them off of her feet when home.  The same daughter rarely ever wanted to wear slippers that she had in the past - she loves these that much (which makes me happy as the floor of our basement duplex apartment can get very chilly in winter). I have since purchased a size Large of these slippers from Amazon so I can have my own pair.  I love them and totally recommend them.  Note - although they are not constructed with a 'non-slip' style bottom (the bottoms are made of the same leather suede that the rest of the outer walls are made with), they (so far) have not been slippery at all, even on the smooth kitchen floor.\n",
      "923 Love these sandals. They are so comfy!! And, is wide enough for my wide feet.\n",
      "924 Too wide and too big\n",
      "925 I love them! They fit great and they arrived weeks before I was expecting them! I am very pleased with my purchase and with shipment!\n",
      "926 These are great! Really comfortable, was a good price and great to walk in all day.\n",
      "927 i'm a J Renee wearer 99% of my dress shoes are J Renee . I was shocked this shoe ran small.\n",
      "928 Comfy but not true to size.\n",
      "929 Very good\n"

      "933 I bought these shoes in black last year and really liked them.  I needed a pair of these same shoes in red this year, but everyone was out of this color.  Then, I thought of Amazon and they had my size in red.  These sandal can be worn for casual or dressy.  I also like the fact that they have velcro adjustable straps.\n",
      "934 I love these sneakers.  I need them in different colors.\n",
      "935 Great shoe.  Perfect fit.  Can not go wrong with this product.  I would buy it again.\n",
      "936 I love these shoes but they are too tight across my instep. I have to return them.\n",
      "937 Does not fit as well as the older H701334 Caribbean Coral Thong it replaced. This shoe has a raised heel pad, the older shoe  had a cupped hell support that prevented side to side slip when walking.\n",
      "938 Nice looking and more importantly, look like the picture.\n",
      "939 I bought these for stepping in and out of my tent, walking to the restroom while keeping tootsies warm and clean! They were prefect! It says men but i bought the women's sizing. I plan to use them as my new slippers for winter!\n",
      "940 Such a Beautiful Shoe!!! Bought for my son's wedding. Not sure if I will be able to last the whole night in them. But, gorgeous!  They have a really nice subtle sparkle to them as well. True to size. Although, I will say seem a bit wide. Going to try the ball foot pads and see if it helps with this and adds comfort.\n",
      "941 Great fit.this is my second pair and have had no problems\n",
      "942 These puppies are so comfortable I put them on as soon as I get home from work. Will order the next pair two sizes longer. Things are a little snug right now but the slipper soon molds to your foot.  4.5 stars!\n",

      "947 the most durable pair of slippers for men in the market. Rainbow Sandals keeps making it happen.\n",
      "948 love chacos and always wear them BUT... this brand was the first one that actually broke down on me.  the side straps DO NOT go all the way through, like they do on the unaweep models.  if the strap is not connected, it WILL pull out at some point.  this did.<br /><br />  we shoved the strap back in where it pulled out using a butter knife and then shot in some gorilla glue (only thing available).  it worked temporarily and had to be done again.  the last time, the gorilla glue expanded to form a lump.  we crushed it down, so now, they seem to be holding.  still, its just a matter of time.<br /><br />  chacos are a great brand, but stick with the z1 or the z2 if you *really* use them.\n",
      "949 Good product ...<br />Price are bit expensive\n",
      "950 These are gorgeous shoes! I ultimately returned because I found another pair I fell in love with, but the choice was not easy! Would have loved to have more occasions to wear such a lovely shoe because I would have kept if I thought I could get reasonable use out of them. Fits true to size.\n",
      "951 Best buy ever!!\n",
      "952 Wayfarer style.  They look great. Lenses are a little cheap (plastic) but for the price they are perfectly appropriate, especially since they are polarized.  Great for driving or by the pool.  Kept one pair, gave one to my wife.  Would definitely buy again!  Please note these are MATTE finish.  Turns out I like that better than glossy but was surprised when first opening.\n",

      "959 Cute but way too big.\n",
      "960 I love them I've been looking everywhere for them.\n",
      "961 Although I put it as Fit as expected, This is because it is as what a size 5 while i am more of a 4.5M. So it is slightly loose for me. I wish they make smaller size shoes though.<br />Overall, it has a nice professional look, and is comfortable. The quality looks good.<br />The white is white so that is one key reason why i like it.\n",
      "962 First time buyer of walking shoes by Skecher...Great shoe!!\n",
      "963 These are a little flimsy and the &#34;leather&#34; was pretty smashed up and wrinkled.  They work for a little girl in dance who doesn't need something fancy, though.\n",
      "964 They do not have a removable insole, only problem.\n",
      "965 I was only disappointed in the color.  I was looking for burgundy, when it came. it's much lighter than the picture.\n",
      "966 It's a great shoe. They look exactly like the picture shows. I have no complaints. I would recommend taking into consideration the fact that you won't be wearing socks when selecting the correct size. The sizes run the same as all other Adidas shoes. I wear an 11.5 in Adidas and I bought an 11.5 not really thinking about the fact that I wouldn't be wearing socks. It's slightly loose, but still okay to me. I might get a 1/2 size smaller next time.\n",

      "976 Cute, but not really comfortable. They are tight across my arch and by end of the day...ouch. If I could do it all over again I would order them in wide. I was in a bind and needed to wear them otherwise would have returned them for another size.\n",

Of course you can use the little tie in the front to tighten the shoe around the foot. So with this, they work well! And they came in the cutest box. Now her feet won't get dirty in our mommy and me class :) (she's only 2.5yrs)\n",
      "983 Excellent Thank You\n",

      "986 Gave it as a gift and loved it so much, got one for myself.  Roomy, and well crafted.  We really love this!\n",
      "987 These slippers were given as a gift and my dad absolutely loves them.<br /><br />As is characteristic with these types of slippers, the rawhide &#34;shoe laces&#34; on the front don't always want to stay tied when you cross your feet while laying in the recliner.  My suggestion to my dad was apply a small dab of wood glue or Gorilla glue to the knot and snug the knot up tight - that should hold it in place.  I've done that before on similar styles of slippers and it's worked fine.  This minor issue is not a problem with this specific L.B. Evans slipper, but rather this style of shoe/slipper so no deduction of stars here.<br /><br />While my dad has only been wearing them for a few days now, he says that they appear to be very well constructed and are very comfortable.  He doesn't wear socks with his house slippers so these fit very well in his normal shoe size and he loves the fleece lining.  All in all, in his estimation, they are outstanding slippers and, in my opinion, they were priced right!\n",

      "995 Joya shoes are the best shoes on the Planet. I have flat feet and would need to wear inserts in any other shoe, but I can be on my feet all day without inserts with Joya Shoes. I own 5 pairs, including hiking boots and they are all amazing. They have my highest recommendation.\n",
      "996 Strange, but I purchased size 8 and there were small for me and 8,5too large, Usually I have no problem with shoes but here I need to find something else\n",

      "1001 Very cute boots.  Listened to what reviewers said and I ordered a 6 1/2 instead of my usual 7.  Fit is nice. Leather is a bit cheap looking but the style of the boot is very cute and unusual.  I will keep them. Price was great.\n",
      "1002 Just tested these out this weekend hiking and they are so comfortable. I'm a size 10 but ordered a 10.5 as I was recently on a long hike with size 10 sneakers and towards the end the downhill was killing my toes. Just enough extra room. Buy these!\n",
      "1003 They looked too manly, especially with the seam down the middle.  Couldn't feel good about these no matter how badly I wanted to.\n",
      "1004 Great for wide flat feet\n",
      "1005 like the look\n",
      "1006 Love the shoes! Fit perfect! Look great!\n",
      "1007 I was sent a pair with elastic straps. I do not like the look or feel of them, and they make putting on the shoe annoying . I ordered a size up and they are extremely snug. I would have worked on stretching them out, but I chose this style specifically because I wanted a pair without straps. So...fail.\n",
      "1008 I've purchased many pairs of Fit Flops.  I love them!\n",
      "1009 The shoe would have been very comfortable, it was soft, the footbed lining was very cushioned, I liked the heel height and the non skid sole, but I'm in-between a size 5 (too small) and the 5.5 slipped on my heel.\n",
      "1010 I wanted these to work, but the front toe strap was much too narrow.  I have a foot that is on the wide side and I couldn't even get my toes to the front of the shoe because the leather strap is so narrow.  The leather is very stiff and not pliable so I am not sure if they would have stretched out.\n",
      "1011 Excellent shoes\n",
      "1012 I love Clarks.  I have wide feet, plantar fasciitis, and lots of other feet issues.  I can wear Clarks for long periods of time without pain.  The sandals allow me to wear sandals comfortably.  Love them.  Have five pairs of these sandals in different colors\n",

      "1024 Very comfortable sandal.  I was able to wear it all day while walking in NYC & Philadelphia.  Only problem is the black dye rubbed off on my feet & made them look dirty!!\n",
      "1025 Sharp looking shoe that can work with a suit or jeans.  It's slightly narrower than expected, but one you break' em in, it's fine.<br />That narrowness cost it one star.\n",
      "1026 Great fit & very comfortable\n",
      "1027 I wear a 9.5 in most closed toe shoes. These fit ok in a 9.5 but with a reg sock my big toe was hitting the end when I walked. I returned the 9.5 and got the 10 and it is a much better fit with a hiking sock. The thin insoles were easily removed and I replaced them with an OTC orthotic sport type insole and this is perfection. I can't wait to get out and hike in them this fall. Great purchase! If you like a little more toe room or like to wear a thicker hiking sock go up 1/2 size. I don't think you would be sorry, and at this price?! Wowzaa!\n",

      "1041 Love the look, but the fit is a bit weird. Started with an 8 (my normal size) and they looked way too bug, but the bottom straps were tight. Sized down to a 7.5, and had the same problem. These are just very long and skinny shoes - beautiful, but an odd fit...\n",
      "1042 Nice looking.  Like the organizer.  Great value.\n",
      "1043 Looks exactly like the photo. BUT! The color was a little off.<br />I got the rose red and it came to be more of a dark fusha color. Still cute though. Shoes feels light and it's very comfortable. Also, shoes was perfect fitting. I wear a size 9 so I got a size 9. PERFECT!  Definitely a keeper.\n",
      "1044 Very comforable for all day use.<br /><br />I wear a 10.5 in most brands but based on reciews I ordered a 10 and it fits perfect.\n",

      "1046 This is a wonderful shoe.  Fits well (I have very narrow feet), super comfortable and light.  I'm happy to pay the extra for a product that is made in the USA.  So why 2 stars?<br /><br />I have worn this model for several years.  The first ones started to smell like cat urine (the outside of the soles near the heel) after a few months wear.  New Balance replaced the first pair TWICE at no charge, saying a problem with some adhesive caused the shoes to develop an odor similar to cat urine.  This year, they decided they would not replace them since they were way outside warranty.  That is perfectly understandable.  So I bought a new pair in January, 2015.  Seven months later, one shoe started to have that cat urine-like smell again.  It was only on the outside.  So I contacted New Balance again.  Here is their response:<br /><br />&#34;I am sorry you are experiencing an odor issue with your 990 shoes. I understand in the past we mentioned the odor issue is caused by an adhesive in the shoes. I would like to correct what we have told you in the past. After research and testing we have found the adhesive was not the issue in the odor issue. What we have found the odor is from moisture getting trapped in the shoe and the shoe not being able to completely dry out. The odor does take time to develop within the shoe if not completely dried out before the next wearing.<br /><br />The 990 shoe does have a less breathable upper which makes it harder for the shoe to completely dry out before the next wearing vs. shoes that have a mesh upper are able to dry out at a faster rate than the 990 shoes. We have also found the best way to dry out the shoes is to remove the insoles, loosen the laces, and pull the tongue forward. This is the best way to dry out the shoes to help prevent the odor issue.&#34;<br /><br />Thanks, New Balance, for the explanation.  But please ponder this.  One shoe of my current pair (7 months old) has that odd smell on the OUTSIDE of the sole, not the inside.  If it is a moisture issue, why doesn't the inside smell like the outside?  So far that question has not been explained to me by New Balance. And I don't believe I have exceptionally sweaty feet.  Plus, this has not been an issue in any other shoe I own.<br /><br />Again, these shoes are not cheap.  And I will gladly pay for US-made shoes.  And the fit and comfort are exceptional.  But please consider the odor issue when purchasing.\n",

      "1049 Just recieved these and was kinda nervous ordering online before trying them on first, but I absolutely love them!!! Color of these are awesome and they fit perfectly. Nice case that comes with them also definitely a thumbs up!\n",
      "1050 My child loves them!!!!\n",
      "1051 The Skechers were recommended by my physician to help heal my plantar fasciitis.  The first pair I bought several years ago had the sole separate and fall apart. I decided to try again. The pair I bought a month ago are falling apart on the inside. The liner is tearing and shredding. I hope they will last another month since they cost over $100.\n",
      "1052 Sent them back, to tight\n",
      "1053 3 stars at best, took these on a few light duty trails and they were fine, not as much cushioning as my aging feet like but they were decent. Brought them on a fairly serious hike on Glen Boulder Trail -&#62; Mt. Isolation up in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, ran most of the way, I'm an aggressive descender and weigh in about 190#'s. Several of the lugs ripped off and they look like shoes that have about 200+ miles on them after at most 35 miles, most of the wear was from one hike/run, plus the feet were killing me from the strike toe strike area really not doing much absorption. I can't see why these are rated so high, I wish I could have my money back, total waste... These were a total let down. They might be fine for someone lighter and less aggressive on the gnarly stuff but for my use, these are terrible. I did my due diligence and am hoping to save someone else with similar needs the loss of precious funds...\n",
      "1054 My wife says that they are very comfortable.  Exactly what to expect from Clarks shoes, except they are sandals.  She want another pair for next summer...\n",
      "1055 Great shoe!  Can wear it casual, or dressy.\n",
      "1056 I was excited to try them on. They were great, fit great, look great. Just at first some letters were written on the frame that wouldnt come off. Until i emailed the company. It came off right away with warm water.\n",
      "1057 Love them and have had them before so I know to order the larger size, so they fit as expected 😀<br /><br />They definitely help my posture and I feel the tingly sensation sooner when walking from using more muscles.\n",
      "1058 Puma is the Only Shoe I have ordered from Amazon, that seems to fit the almost right way. Others are too big...<br />Amazon Boots fit just right and seem to be the only Shoe that can be ordered and fits correctly.<br />I don't know what has happened to the American  / European Shoe Industry in the last 10 to 20 years, shoes seem to not be sized correctly anymore.<br />Maybe the only shoes that are sized correctly are Cement now a days.<br />I recommend not buying shoes at all off of Amazon unless you want to become a Buyer for Crossroads or Goodwill.\n",
      "1059 Good buy! This bag's nice... although it's a little smaller than what I expected.\n",
      "1060 A little small but not to bad. Should have just gone up a size\n",
      "1061 Not 5 stars for the product....the sandals were way too big, but not their fault...but 5 stars for their eventual positive customer attitude. Camel came around to fulfilling my request for a full refund, and they did not require me to return the sandals. All ends well, and I would try again with this vendor.\n",
      "1062 I love love love these sooooooo much!\n",
      "1063 Look very nice with jeans and slacks. They're super comfortable and I got loads of compliments on them. I was a bit concerned that the heel might be s little high and uncomfortable, but they feel good, not too high at all. Very nice shoes. I got them in the black suede too. I'm set for Fall!\n",

      "1070 Very fast delivery & I'm happy with the glasses. I am a woman & they are not too masculine. I am still looking for a more feminine pair that are equally dark. These are also not the darkest locs I've ever had, but I like them\n",
      "1071 Love them❤️\n",
      "1072 i love it too very much\n",
      "1073 These are great the fit was amazing & not sure how but crocs are so comfortable & durable. Highly recommended for those who have boys that are very harsh on their foot ware. These particular ones I paid $22 so for the price there are unbeatable\n",

      "1075 Very light weight and comfortable to wear.\n",
      "1076 Good sturdy frames, they don't feel cheaply made.  I just wish the lenses were a little darker.  It's kind of hard to tell from the pics online.  I still wear them when I'm out.\n",
      "1077 Overall comfortable sandal. Just a little wide. I actually have 3 other colors. They don't have an arch support, but they didn't' make my arches hurt either.\n",
      "1078 Great shoes for a great price.  This is the second pair I've bought of this style.  I wear them without socks & would recommend the same.  These shoes are attention grabbers, as I receive a lot of compliments.\n",
      "1079 Arrived on time. Packaged well. Very satisfied with product.\n",
      "1080 Love the look - was surprised at how narrow these ones fit this time - I always buy 8 1/2 addidas - got 2 different pairs - the others fit perfect (powerblaze running shoe) and these will stretch but I they were tight and left my feet sore after day 1 - day 2 was better.\n",
      "1081 Cute and decent quality, but runs about a half size small.\n",
      "1082 Got these shoes just before we went out West and put a lot of walking miles on them.  Very comfortable and great value and price.\n",
      "1083 I love these shoes. I originally had the same pair but I lost one while hiking through a creek. They're super comfy. The only negative thing I would say is don't wear them when it rains you will most likely slip and fall .\n",

      "1088 Bigger than case for Costa Fisch glasses case I replaced.\n",
      "1089 I have very flat feet and would have extreme pain for a day or two after doing TKD.  With these shoes, I immediate felt a huge difference and I know I can do TKD for years now!  Because of the different material on the sole, it has taught me to rotate better on my feet and allows me to be more aggressive with my actions!  This was the best purchase I ever could have dreamed of for TKD.<br /><br />If you have arch problems or pain, buy these shoes, you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "1090 Wish I knew about this things back in the day. Been using for the past few months now and even after extensive use of some of my cleats and indoor soccer shoes, they smell as new as they were on the first day. Just put in there after done playing and leave there until next time.\n",
      "1091 look beautiful ..I'm very happy\n",
      "1092 Really Like The Shoes..\n",
      "1093 In love! These fit like a glove, are light weight and super comfortable.  First time I wore these shoes was a day of walking and standing at a sporting event.  My feet felt great.  Looking forward to wearing them to Disneyland! Great buy!\n",
      "1094 I haven't worn Contemporas for years, but I thought I'd try a pair when I saw the price. Unfortunately, they run a little narrower than I remember and I had to send the C width shoes back.<br /><br />Some sizing feedback for those who don't live a dancewear store stocking this shoe in your size: the shoe length was true to sizing guidelines (subtract 2.5 from your street shoe size) - I wear a women's 11 and size 8.5 pointes were the correct length. If you wear a medium width but larger shoe size, I would recommend trying the D width instead of the C width.\n",
      "1095 my cousin love it...\n",
      "1096 Glasses arrived broken. And on top of this, they are very large, more so than you'd think from looking at the picture. I also have my doubts about them being polarized.\n",
      "1097 I give this product a ten on comfort and a three on style.  I have arthritis and fibromyalgia so walking can be extremely painful.  After tearfully saying goodbye to my high heals these were recommended to me by several people. They feel like walking on air. They are the only shoes that do not bother my hip and knee pain, but actually help it.  Now the down side is they are not exactly stylish or cute.  I feel like an old lady in these.  I wish they would make some other more up to date stylish options with the same comfort level.  I have bought the boat shoes they make with the yoga material inside, and while not uncomfortable these go walk shoes are way more comfortable.\n",
      "1098 I gave three stars because even though they pook great the size isnt the same as your usual shoes. And they didn't mention this. If you buy it get a pair 0.5 size higher than usual.\n",
      "1099 I select my size very carefully, still it was quite small. My foot could not fit, if it did it was forcefully. I was very upset upon buying something from amazon to wear and it was horrible size wise. Disappointed.\n",

      "1104 Usually ordered the pro grid but tried these and regret it. The others are better. Got blisters and my leg hurt a lot after walking half an hour.\n",
      "1105 Very comfortable for a few hours, apparently not good to walk in them all day with a short break in period as I did get a blister on my toe and soreness on the outside of my feet near the back strap where the support is either a bit high or not wide enough for my foot. Hoping they will become more comfortable as I wear them more often for shorter periods of time. Normally wear a size 6.5, went with a 7 - the straps are made of a soft material and are very comfortable -  not too loose for being a half size bigger as they are adjustable.\n",
      "1106 Boots are amazing, they fit perfectly and feel great with the extra padding provided with order.\n",
      "1107 Wore them to work right after I opened them out of the box and was very impressed. They're cute and casual and I adore them.\n",

      "1112 It's my fault, I should have ordered a 13.  They are too narrow, too small and I normally 11.5 and figured the 12 would be nice.  If you wear anything above a 10.... just get the 13.  They are constructed really well and I did manage to wear them for a few hours while in Ecuador as inside shoes.  But I left them there with a friend who wears size 10 and they fit him perfect.<br /><br />If they had fit like they were supposed to, I would have loved them.  I would have returned them too, but they were a last minute item for my trip and then I left them behind as a gift.\n",
      "1113 I loved the feel, look, and color of these shoes, but I had to send them back. Im waiting for a larger size to arrive. I ordered a 1/2 size down after reading the reviews....but I couldn't even get them on! I ordered a 1/2 size larger this time, and am hoping they fit!!! Update: the second pair arrived,..and one shoe felt 1/2 size tighter than the other. ...but I kept them. Sadly after paying $46 here, I saw them at TjMax for $29\n",
      "1114 I usually wear Skechers Go Walk shoes. The Crocs aren't as &#34;cushy&#34;, but they're very light and comfortable, and don't look quite as &#34;old lady&#34; as the Go Walk.\n",

      "1125 I LOVE these shoes. They're a little big, but that's my own fault. I have changing feet that could be either a 7 or 7.5 on any given day. Either way, they're INCREDIBLY comfortable.\n",

      "1159 Newton makes very good shoes for someone looking to improve their running form by making you strike on the midfoot.  I've been running in them for about 3 weeks, and still feel soreness in my calves, but I can also feel those muscles strengthening, and I notice a change in my stride when I run in other shoes as well.  The shoes themselves don't make you faster, but they help you to become a better runner.  I have the Gravity and the Distance.  Ironically, the Gravity is designed for longer distances than the Distance (poor name choice IMO).  The Gravity is a little heavier and made of more cushioned, durable material than the Distance.  I like both.  I'll probably wear the Gravity in an upcoming marathon and use the Distance for track running and 5-10K runs.\n",

Now this Is preliminary and if time dictates that the quality is not as perceived I will amend my review accordingly. I am looking forward to testing out how well they hold out water and how comfortable they'll be on ever longer hikes but for a short but hard trek, they did the job and handled the varying terrain (mostly rocky) quite well. I am pleased with this purchase and I would recommend these to other hikers or outdoor enthusiasts.\n",

They are comfortable and I have tossed them in the washer a number of times and they still look great.  Wish I could afford to have a pair in every color.  The exchange process with Amazon was extremely easy.  No complaints.\n",
      "1174 They are costume boots. What does this mean? Not much in way of support and the exterior around the ankle collapses just like the image. Also, the zippers are touchy, so no being rough with them. For the price, they are exactly what you would expect. I plan on wearing these for a number of outings, not just once, and they will handle that just fine. I've used other Funtasma boots and they are still going strong after dozens of uses and miles of walking. I put in my own supports, so they feel just fine on my feet after a couple hours of wear and really, that is a necessity. If you are looking for inexpensive costume boots, Funtasma is the standard. If you want something better, expect to spend a lot more money.\n",

I put these on and said &#34;I can't believe I paid this much for a pair of sandals, but if they last they are worth every penny!&#34;<br />So comfortable. I love the support, the soft lining. My only concern is that they are made in China. (Stamped on sandal) Because I am in another industry in which China is a big competitor I am familiar with  the standards and quality control of China being less uniform and consistent, so  I reserve my judgement on their durability. I will check back in a year to comment on how well they hold up. For now, I am wearing them almost everyday. My feet are so happy!\n",
      "1181 Great little boots!\n",
      "1182 Even though I do like these shoes, they are a little heavy. I bought these for my little guy who has very 'chubby' feet. The multiple straps are perfect at securing the shoes to his feet. However, he is learning to walk with shoes and I just feel that these shoes are a little heavy. I worry that that might be an issue with the learning process.\n",

      "1191 [[ASIN:B0128NXBJI Rocks Eyewear - Emerald Yellow - Made in Italy - Men & Women Sunglasses]] I ordered this in yellow for my boyfriend as a gift. It looks great and stylish! He loves how lightweight it is, and how the bright & cool the reflective yellow color is! The quality of both the rim and the lenses are also good. The black rim is flexible all around and has this cool, matte feel to it. We also both think it feels incredible on your face. The UV protection is excellent for the lenses and I don't get a weird glare from the sunlight as you do with some cheaper glasses. Definitely also perfect for a sporty look/style.  To Summarize: -Great value for money. The quality all around is excellent. -The style and fit is excellent. -It's lightweight and flexible. Feels cool to touch and feels great when on your face. -UV protection and visibility through the lenses are awesome -Love the bright reflective color\n",

      "1195 I was tempted to buy a pair of Vans or Chuck's, but after reading the reviews on amazon as well finding out that Mark Bell 'powerlifter' was involved in the design of these Crossfit Lite TR's...I had to give the shoes a try.  Surprisingly the design of the foot-bed has more cushion than I expected for a fairly flat surface shoe.  They use Ortholite insoles so it's not uncomfortable at all, at least for a few hours of use at a time.  These were designed for powerlifting...not Olympic weightlifting, there is a difference.<br /><br />I have fairly flat feet and noticed most arched supported shoes don't help me in staying 'grounded' to the floor when performing squats, deadlifts or even leg presses.  I bought Asics wrestling shoes to get a more flat feel to my stance and they helped when using them on legs days but they still were 'too' flexible for my taste.  Although, I 'm not sure how these will do during calf exercises due to the stiffness of the soles.  Again, don't expect very much arch support...not the intent of these shoes.<br /><br />These Crossfit Lite TR's covers the best of my needs in a powerlifting shoe.  They fit perfectly...<br />*The best 'grounding' feeling of stability and great heel support<br />*The larger toe box was genius, most tennis type shoes tend to be tight for me<br />*Not a very heavy shoe at all, very comfortable\n",
      "1196 nice and comfortable\n",
      "1197 I was very hesitant on buying Chacos because they are pretty expensive. I caught them on a sale so I couldn't pass them up. I bought them bc we are going on a cruise soon, and I wanted a sturdy sandal that I could wear at the ports. I usually can wear anywhere between a 8.5 - 9.5 size shoe, so I ordered a 9 thinking it would be fine. They ended up being a little too big, so I plan on sending them back and getting an 8. The little bit of walking I did around the house just to see how they felt proved to me that Chacos are worth it. Super comfortable. I just wish that they weren't sliding off of my foot! No compaints, but half sizes would be awesome though.\n",
      "1198 So comfortable!!!\n",
      "1199 Good bargain.  Timely delivery.  Quality shoe.\n",
      "1200 Nice looking glasses its a gift for  someone and hope they like it too.\n",
      "1201 Snug to start and broke in nicely.\n",
      "1202 My little girl loves those shoes, of course everyone wears them these days. Because they are cut out more than the boy kind, these don't stay on her feet as good as they should. We decided to buy some other shoes meanwhile so she can grown into those.\n",
      "1203 The design and the quality look excellent. the boat is not so heavy as expected.\n",
      "1204 I love the color and design. It's not my first Dansko pair and I expected some break-in period. This pair was pretty comfortable from the get go, except for the top of the shoe still is tight on my foot (the part that goes right over the highest point of the foot rise (thus is 4 stars).\n",
      "1205 these shoes are great i ordered a second pair for a friend\n",
      "1206 Perfect fit as I expected. Good quality shoe.\n",
      "1207 they are a little smaller than expected for width.  I would order a size larger next time.  Very comfortable\n",
      "1208 These shoes are super cute and much safer than cheap child flip flops. My daughter has worn them almost every day this past summer.  I love the Croc material as it is durable and comfortable to wear. My daughter did get an odd blister on her big toe from it rubbing, but she also walks more on her toes so I think she was putting too much pressure in that one location.\n",
      "1209 I don't ever write reviews normally.  But I was hesitant to buy this online because I like to try my shoes on before I buy them.  Well if your looking at this boot online chances are you either heard about it being great or bought it for yourself and found out.  Instantly comfortable, very durable and exacting fit.  I wear a 13 EE and usually the chances of me finding that at a retail store are slim to zero.  These fit even better then the ones I bought at a sporting goods store several years ago.<br /><br />If your are thinking about buying a great set of boots online I highly suggest you check these guys out.  Great service fast shipping A+++. Thanks\n",
      "1210 my 8th pair\n",
      "1211 Good price for a good shoe.  It was 50% off!\n",
      "1212 I love these! I bought them for myself (female adult) because I thought they were cool and if I fits, I wear its. They are comfortable but a little high cut because it's right on the edge of my ankle bone and over my Achilles so it's rubbing and bending when I walk, causing blisters. I'm hoping that'll go away once I've worn them out.<br />Love that they light up in the dark so my friends can find me when we're out :)\n",
      "1213 very uncomfortable\n",
      "1214 Just as advertised, great service\n",
      "1215 Freakin cool!! I love it :p\n",
      "1216 I adore these boots. They're the only thing my daughter wore for the first year of her life. They stay on her feet, while looking completely adorable. Totally worth the $!\n",
      "1217 I just received these shoes so I have no idea how well they will hold up but for now they are my favorite walking shoes. Extremely comfortable, easy slip on and off, these are my go to shoes for everything but work. Very light, the cushioned inside is awesome. I walked a trail in these bad boys and despite the rocks, roots, and sticks, I hardly felt anything but cushion. I really hope they last a while.\n",
      "1218 Awesome shoes! So comfortable & no blisters, they wear & wore nicely all day at school ;-)\n",
      "1219 The shoes were just a tad snug at the big toe and the color is more silver than expected. overall a nice looking & feeling shoe.\n",
      "1220 I have terrible neuropathy from back surgery that affects my legs and feet terribly.  We went on holiday recently and I was terrified that I would be in terrible pain and would be unable to do all the walking our holiday would require.  Plus, they are pretty.  These were a God-send for me.  For days and days these sandals kept my feet walking and nearly pain free.  Now I need to find something to wear for the winter months.  Thanks Aetrex!\n",
      "1221 Pretty flats,  a little stiff out of the box but awesome otherwise. My kid hates shoes but managed to keep these on for a couple of hours before flinging them under the table at a wedding.\n",
      "1222 I am very pleased with my new coach sunglasses. They are the perfect weight and fit . And best of all they were reasonably priced .\n",
      "1223 Love it\n",
      "1224 I've been wearing some variation of Ecco's Track 6 shoe for over 10 years now - this is my 5th pair - and they have been consistently great shoes. I'm pretty rough on them, so while my older pairs are &#34;cosmetically distressed,&#34; they are otherwise as comfortable and as serviceable as they were they day I got them. Highly recommended.\n",
      "1225 Returned them - they run at least a size small.\n",
      "1226 Great\n",
      "1227 Very Comfortable\n",
      "1228 My favorite shoes. Very comfortable, very stylish, and I will definitely be buying more in the future. Expensive price tag is totally worth it. Ive had mine for years and they're still holding up very well\n",
      "1229 Really cute shoes\n",
      "1230 I bought these for my son's 18th birthday and he absolutely loved them.  Very quick service.\n",
      "1231 THEY RAN TOO SMALL. I'VE BEEN BUYING THEM FOR 4 YEARS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHANGED, I'M 62 YEARS OLD SO I KNOW IT'S NOT MY FOOT. I WANT TO EXCHANGE THEM FOR A LARGER SIZE. I WORE THE ONE PAIR TODAY. I LOVE YOUR BOOTS USUALLY. USE THEM FOR WORK AND HIKING.\n",
      "1232 So small that I can't wear them. There is no return information from this seller so I do not recommend this product.\n",
      "1233 Very Bad'''<br />Its quality is very poor'''<br />Let me Very disappointed '''\n",
      "1234 Fit perfect, comfortable for hiking and spending all day on your feet!\n",
      "1235 I like the feel of the bumps inside, kinda massages your feet while wearing and walking in 'em. personally, not for all day wear for me, but that's probably relative to the wearer as most things are.\n",
      "1236 A bit smaller than same size bought before, toe straps somewhat tight also. Working them in\n",
      "1237 Very cute, but large on my 14mo. She's in the 50% for height and weight, so average sized baby, but these won't fit her for awhile.\n",
      "1238 I love Toms and the order was shipped very quickly\n",
      "1239 fit, design and finishing are very good. I gave four stars because I did expected it genuine suede leather.\n",
      "1240 So far so good. Very comfortable, they don't hug your face so a little air can circulate in there. Seem wider than most so would be good on larger faces.\n",
      "1241 perfect!\n",
      "1242 Superb comfort.  Look even better in person.\n",
      "1243 Fits well just as seem very pretty and comfy.I love every thing about this shoe.\n",
      "1244 already returned it\n",
      "1245 Bought because size said 3.1 inch but was only 2 -5/8 inch. Kept because my roommate wanted one and 2 5/8 was ok\n",
      "1246 With too low a heel, they come off very easily. They do have a good non skid sole but tend to fall off unless you pick your foot straight up when moving forward.\n",
      "1247 great\n",
      "1248 I've owned these for a period of almost two years and they look great, which speaks for the quality of the design and materials. However, there are two slight issues that work themselves into one: sole wear and traction in wet/slipper surfaces (hence the 4 stars). There isn't any, even from the start. You'll quickly find yourself ice skating in restrooms, marble floors, and puddles.\n",
      "1249 This bag is more beautiful in person.<br />Sparkles like diamonds under light. Perfect size. Comes with optional shoulder chain or smaller handle chain.<br />Very pleased.\n",
      "1250 Really like it, great style and most comfortable touch.\n",
      "1251 Fit perfect , great quality , really like the style\n",
      "1252 Good quality shoes for my son's High school uniform\n",
      "1253 I absolutely LOVE these shoes.  I bought them for Beach Body's T25 which is a lot of jumping and lateral movements, and they have far exceeded my expectations.  They are a great shoe and this was an excellent price.\n",
      "1254 Super comfy!\n",

      "1257 When I went to the local shoe stores to figure out my son's shoe size, which is a 14 in the other shoes. I ordered that size. When they arrived, he tried them on and they barely fit.\n",
      "1258 I have owned these in the past and loved them.  They changed the shoes though, I had to buy an entire size larger then the pair I got last year\n",
      "1259 fits perfectly\n",
      "1260 Very nice\n",
      "1261 good\n",
      "1262 These are so cute!  I ordered up 1/2 size like reviews said, however, for my foot, looks like I need a full size up.  So I just returned these and ordered another pair.  Very cute, light and stylish, I can't wait for me new pair!\n",
      "1263 Great, half eye you can stick in your pocket\n",

      "1265 WONDERFUL FUZZIES\n",
      "1266 Great product for the price! Love the set of threes, because he is always losing them. My husband has a large head and it's sometimes hard to find glasses that fit... These are perfect\n",
      "1267 I ordered the green, pink & black in size 8. The green & pink fit fine but the black was easily 1 size too large. Seems the black run larger so be mindful if you order the black. The shoes do smell but after awhile the odor goes away. The smell is not as bad as people say. I love the shoes. They are super cute. They are completely flat though, so not the best thing for your feet. I'm going to put shoe insoles in them to give them some arch support.\n",
      "1268 They are cheaply made, I won't wear them outside in the winter as I think my feet will get too cold since these are not made with leather.\n",
      "1269 My only problem with them is that the surface finish of the shoes has started to peel off.\n",
      "1270 Very comfortable and cute!\n",
      "1271 Love it. The perfect size.\n",
      "1272 The ankle strap was tight, the heel strap rubbed a blister\n",

      "1274 Excellent travel bag\n",
      "1275 Looks good with everything. Lightweight makes it especially comfortable and possible to wear all day. Love the height, and because of the platform you don't feel it when you're wearing them.\n",
      "1276 Great look and wonderful price!\n",
      "1277 Love the feel of this shoe, I have used them to walk outside and they are very comfortable.\n",
      "1278 Shoes run large. Had to return them\n",
      "1279 Better than as pictured. Comfortable for long wear. Warm. Versatile style. Order a size up, however. I'm a 10 and needed an 11.\n",

      "1281 Love them!\n",
      "1282 Very comfortable! Love these shoes.\n",
      "1283 The foot fitter worked ok and as expected. The insertion buttons seem to by a kind of plastic rather than a sturdier material like aluminum or something. Other than this it is easy to use.<br />Fast shipping\n",
      "1284 Very cheap looking.  The lighter color on the pair I got looked like it had been painted in.  There were what looked like brush lines and dots/streaks of darker brown throughout the lighter leather.  Very disappointed.\n",
      "1285 it's a great boot, not one complaint.been wearing Wolverine boots now for maybe 10 or more years.\n",
      "1286 They were cheap and not at all what I was expecting. No sparkles and badly made\n",
      "1287 I wear a 12.5, one of the half sizes that is difficult to find.  These fit perfectly and were comfortable from the first day they arrived. I walk on gravel daily at work and needed a trailer runner to avoid tracking rocks into the office. Some shoes claiming to be trail runners will pick up rocks and mud in the tread, these have the proper tread design to avoid picking up debris. They have a little extra support towards the outside of the foot that might not be for everyone, but is what I needed.\n",
      "1288 Comfortable shoes but be aware that a 14 shoe is 49 cm, instead of 48 like some other shoe manufacturers.\n",
      "1289 too large\n",

      "1292 Beautiful shoe. True to size. Buy it\n",
      "1293 Love these shoes!\n",
      "1294 These shoes are beautiful. The shoes were delivered when they said they would be delivered.\n",
      "1295 I wear an 7.5/8.0<br />I bought these in an 8.5 becuase the other ratings noted a smaller size. They were right. These boots are tight around the toes (actually pretty much just overall to small) and have absolutely no support, making them very uncomfortable.<br />I do like the style of them though, even if the material kinda feels like spray fainted foam.\n",
      "1296 Great product. Fits as expected.\n",
      "1297 Cutest shoes ever with all the bling my granddaughter needs to top off her outfits.\n",
      "1298 Received my Clarks boots in Navy and am trying to decide whether to keep them or not. I wear a 7 and a half and they fit fine<br />with a tall knee sock and my jeans. They come to about 2&#34; below my knee and I 'am 5'2&#34;. I do have room to wear a thicker sock<br />in the winter as the toe box is big enough with out pinching my toes.<br />They look like a rubber winter boot and that is what I don't like. It says they are leather but just don't look like it. I wanted a dress<br />leather navy boot.<br />I will probably keep them because they have a big restocking fee if I send them back, and were very reasonable in price. We have a long winter here in Va, so can use them in the snow.<br />I guess I will try for a more dressy navy leather one and make sure I read the return policy first.\n",
      "1299 I have been a big fan of the Vigor series. I have owned several pairs with no complaints. One of the best trail running shoes you can buy for the money my opinion. I have run multiple 50K races with my Vigors and they have done great. I have tried other trail running shoes that cost well over $100 and have been disappointed. Just remember to order 1/2 size up from your typical size.\n",
      "1300 I love these sunglasses.  They are sturdy and well made but not &#34;heavy&#34;.  Plus they look good!\n",

      "1304 very comfortable\n",
      "1305 The Roxanne Crochet Flats are so comfortable and cute.  They have a rubber sole and are in a crochet type pattern that has a metallic finish to it.  They work perfect for tons of my outfits since I ordered the Natural flats.  I ordered size 7 and I usually wear a size 7.5 and they fit perfect.  I was really worried that they would be tight since 7 is not my usual size but that is not the case at all.  I am really happy with these and I am happy that I received this product at a discount for my unbiased and honest review.\n",
      "1306 I expected the shoes to be wide---Foreign shoes don't use narrow for width.<br />These shoes look great.\n",
      "1307 Pretty great shoes for the price. I can't complain that much. The only thing i would change about these is that I wish that it would envelop my ankle a bit more because it's pretty out there.\n",
      "1308 Cute shoes.  Fit as your would expect a higher heeled shoe - easy to walk in with block heel, though.\n",
      "1309 Great fit, good price! No need to break them in!!\n",
      "1310 Very sharp looking shoe\n",
      "1311 I received a pair of these for Christmas and loved them so I purchased another pair , very good arch support.\n",
      "1312 These are not Non-Slip. I work them to work (a restaurant kitchen with tile floors) and slide all over the place.\n",
      "1313 pretty and comfortable.\n",
      "1314 Thesea are awesome. Purchased for my 6 year old as part of his school uniform. They look stylish but most importantly they are comy enough for recess.\n",
      "1315 Adorable,...great fit. I love these shoes!!!\n",
      "1316 These shoes were for my son for his new job.  He says they are a bit too tight, but hoping that is just because they are new and need to be broken in a little.  Also, he is not use to a job where he has to be on his feet all day.  They do look very good though.\n",
      "1317 I love my Cat face zipper bag coin bag. I have no idea why I got questions pertaining to shoes when this is a coin bag....lol!\n",
      "1318 This design is the the best i ever tried<br />The problem is decreasing availabelity in the market i am afried price will shoot up\n",
      "1319 I usually wear a 10 or 10.5, and, of course, you can't get 10.5.  So I thought that since these shoes had a strap, an 11 would be just fine.  And, they are.  I think they are true to size.  They are VERY wide, though.  Again, since they have a strap, they work for me.  Some might not like the look since they are so wide.  There is a pattern on the inside sole.  My sister tried them on and she couldn't stand that feeling under her foot.  It doesn't bother me.  I've gotten lots of compliments on them--maybe because they are red?\n",
      "1320 did not like the fit of this shoe. I was quite disappointed. maybe i will try another version but this one I did not like\n",
      "1321 Authentic , elegant and classy . I'm very happy with it . It will meet your expectations and more .\n",
      "1322 Item came on time and as expected.  They run small, one size larger than I normally wear fit perfect.  They are good looking shoes and displace water very well.  No complaints thus far.\n",
      "1323 I tried these on at a store before buying to make sure I ordered the correct size. My feet are a size 9.5-10US, so I tried both the UK7 and UK8. The 7s were very snug and would be more difficult to break in, while the 8s were a bit roomy, even with thick socks. I have narrow feet, and the soles are not too loose. I decided on getting mine in a size UK8. Also, they arrived 2 days before the earliest estimated delivery date. Overall I am very pleased, I only wish these were produced in 1/2 sizes.\n",
      "1324 I wear them around the house all day long.  My heel pain is gone.  Love these slippers.\n",
      "1325 This was a pleasant surprise. Shoes are comfortable. I got a size 11 patent black (I'm usually a size 10, but I heeded everyone's warnings.) It's comfortable and the shape of the shoe is fairly flattering.\n",
      "1326 These are great!  I bought for the fall...\n",
      "1327 So much yes.\n",
      "1328 love love love them!\n",

      "1334 best &#34;flops&#34; ever.  Love Reef Flip Flops and wish I had a pair of every color.\n",
      "1335 Great shoes!\n",
      "1336 I loved these sandals but the fit felt at least a size off. The fact that the front strap can't be adjusted was the deal breaker for me. I''d have ordered the next size down but none were available. I'd say unless you're on the large end of the size order down one size. Returned them :(\n",
      "1337 its a nice fit.<br />fast shipping!\n",
      "1338 Excelent\n",
      "1339 These boots are great. The color is one of those that goes so well with so much, the style is fantastic and they look great with jeans. My only wish is that they were real leather.\n",

      "1345 Very good\n",
      "1346 Overall a good looking comfortable shoe.  They just ran a bit big so 1/2 size smaller would have been perfect!\n",
      "1347 These shoes are absolutely excellent. It's the second pair that I've bought on the last two years. The first pair still looks incredible after being used about once or twice a week during the warm months of the year. The soles are very well made, and you can clearly tell the shoe is of high quality. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "1348 Beautiful sunglasses looksize exactly like the pictures shown.\n",
      "1349 A lot more comfortable than expected. My only issue, and this is small, is that the bottom of the insert should be more textured. They sometimes slide around when you're putting you shoes on.\n",
      "1350 My second pair.  Love them.\n",
      "1351 love! super comfy\n",
      "1352 Runs small. Need to order a size bigger\n",

      "1356 Love these! For the price, they're fantastic and I wear them with everything!\n",
      "1357 i only gave &#34;somewhat small&#34; since they do run small but i had read all the comments for this and bought a 1/2&#34; size larger so that i would fit perfectly. buy a little larger so that you can fit easily.<br /><br />GREAT for weight lifting since it balances you perfectly, BUT not so great for running.\n",

      "1360 It not that bad!\n",
      "1361 I loved these babes! They fit true to size!\n",
      "1362 The support in these shoes is good. I ordered the wide and they fit perfect. They're very comfortable on my 5 mile walks. Would definitely recommend. I'm giving 4 stars because they seem slightly flimsy, and I'm not sure how long they'll last.\n",
      "1363 Not made to wear all day\n",
      "1364 Very nice bag, but it's more of a raspberry color (was hoping for more of the bright pink in the picture). Very simple with no logos (other reviews have mentioned a logo) and very chic. It doesn't open very wide so it can be hard to fish into the bag to easily grab items. It's the perfect size for me since I like medium size bags rather than large ones.\n",
      "1365 Very Good\n",
      "1366 Great shoe, but they do run small. Suggest a 1/2 size up from your normal.\n",

      "1370 Have had trouble for years finding the right fit due to eee width without spending a lot more than I cared to. These fit like a custom shoe the first time I wore them. Could not recommend them higher for similar shoe needs.\n",
      "1371 Kind of like skinny jeans, many posts mentioned narrow shoe sizes: should have ordered the 2x wide version. Didnt work for me but it could work for you\n",
      "1372 Very pretty but not at all how it appears in the picture. It is not shiny, and the middle bag is flat.\n",
      "1373 This is the way I expected skechers to work.  I love them.  I bought a pair a year ago and they were terrific.  I have 2 jobs that I stand and walk all day, so they are terrific.  I would recommend these to everyone.<br /><br />Thank You\n",

      "1389 Love the IC Berlin glasses. They are so well made and versatile but I have the worst luck with them.  I lost these in Hawaii a few months after buying them, which is I think the 4th pair of IC Berlin Shades I've lost. Theyre too expensive for me to keep buying and leaving places, but if you keep better track of your sunglasses than I do, highly recommended.\n",

These shoes have given my feet a chance to recover from years of were from work boots and working out..<br />I won't go in depth regarding the pros and cons,but I will write this, I've only experienced pros from these shoes thus far.\n",
      "1394 Loved it and the size was just right\n",

      "1408 Is the  old design , but is really good the color and the size\n",
      "1409 I love this, it is beautiful. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I thought it was white and it  is actually a cream color. I kept it- still beautiful!!\n",

      "1415 I'm so glad I found this adorable and high quality sandals for my toddler. The same sandals (but in blue color) cost $55 at Geox store and I was ready to buy them at the store. But because the store doesn't have them in my son's size (5,5) I decided to check Amazon and glad I did. Same shoes but just a different color (red is great color as well) and the price is half off. I couldn't be happier! I love GEOX shoes for my baby boy, it was his first walking shoes. I love Pediped as well but compare to Stride Rite this one (Geox) are much MUCH better. The quality stands by itself, and I love the design and the look of the shoes. Highly recommend, especially if you find a great deal like this one.\n",

      "1424 Love the shoes\n",
      "1425 These are super cute shoes IF only my 7 year old could get them on her feet. The &#34;stretch laces for easy on & off&#34; do NOT stretch to allow us to even get them on her foot. I think they would fit if we could actually get them past her heel. VERY disappointed.\n",

      "1435 Love these shoes! They are so comfortable! I was looking to replace an old pair.\n",
      "1436 I bought the shoes as new. Don't give me a beat up box someone saved for 10 years, not acceptable. God only knows if they were new or not. If I bought used shoes fine, new not okay.\n",
      "1437 Glasses are amazing. Authentic product, I'm very satisfied!\n",
      "1438 The product is of good quality and description matches well.\n",
      "1439 These shoes are amazingly comfortable!\n",

      "1451 I have to say I was a little worried about how these would fit. I have purchased shoes online in the past that have not fit as expected. I put these on and right away was very happy. I don't normally wear flats, but think I have a new favorite shoe. I am on my feet all day long at work. I came home from work and as usually kicked off my shoes, slipped these on and was already happy with my purchase. They fit great, look great, feel great. I love how they look with my jeans, and sure they will look just as good with any other outfit. Now all I need is more colors. I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for a honest review.\n",
      "1452 My 2yr old absolutely loves these shoes! She wants to wear them non-stop.  I think she especially likes that she can put them on herself.  We now have them in blue and pink and get compliments on them every time she wears them. I want a pair for myself!\n",
      "1453 I recommend this shoe to anyone that like a comfortable fitting shoe.\n",
      "1454 Great pen case with rapid  delivery.\n",
      "1455 Great\n",
      "1456 The shoes are too wide and fit more like a 7 than the 5 1-2 that they are.  I see no information on returning them for my refund.  How do I go about that ?  There was no paperwork in the box\n",
      "1457 love them.  repeat order'\n",
      "1458 Very nice ballet shoe but it has a very slick black sole unlike the brown pair I have.  It was too dangerous on carpet and tile which is why I has to return it.\n",
      "1459 I had to go buy inserts because crocs were too large. Too expensive considering total cost for shoes & inserts. Next time, I'll buy them in a store so I can try them on.\n",
      "1460 Great shoe with a lot of support and cushioning. The only disappointment was the sole wear.\n",
      "1461 Almost nothing to these shoes--light and airy. The back of the heel slips a bit in mid-step, maybe because I don't lace them all the way to the last eyelet.\n",
      "1462 I ordered these as a gift and they were about a half size too small, so I exchanged them.  The exchange was 100% hassle-free and the new ones were perfect!  Great for all types of use from casual to sport--we intend to use them kayaking for a lightweight pull-on shoe we can get in the water with if need be.\n",
      "1463 This is my second pair of Clark's flip flops, and I love them. Well-made, comfortable, can walk all day in them.\n",
      "1464 I feel satisfied with these shoes, beautiful and comfortable, thanks\n",
      "1465 I've had this style of Mephisto shoe before and LOVED them.  I ordered up a size from my usual size, but they were still a bit too short, and too narrow.  Too bad, I really wanted to keep them!\n",
      "1466 Love Clarks, another great shoe. Do make sure to give these a nice clean every now and then so they last a while.\n",
      "1467 Great shoes!!\n",
      "1468 WOW these shoes were made for instant comfort and style.  I have worn the khaki shoes and washed them over and over all spring and summer and they are still such great shape.  They look almost new even after months of wearing them often.  I have ordered a second pair for fall.  This is a great shoe if you need to look dressy casual.  I am 63 and loving the comfort!\n",
      "1469 Awesome flip flops.  Can't believe how comfortable they are - the thong is soft material and the flips flops are actually lined with material that has yoga poses.  I've never put anything on my feet that were as dreamy as these.  The Yoga Mat top is like a mattress for your feet you can wear them 24/7.  Because I've been bragging about my new flip flops - I now have orders from my family I have to fill!\n",
      "1470 Best sandals i have owned.\n",
      "1471 Cute boot but it's too large. My daughter is out of a size 3 shoe and going into a size 4, I even went to a shoe store to get her foot measured. Oh well.\n",
      "1472 I often have to &#34;break&#34; these shoes in over several weeks. I was able to immediate start wearing them all day long! Nice fit\n",
      "1473 These boots are great. I wear a 11 1/2 wide all the time, So I ordered these the same. Will say they were a little loose but there is not much padding in the shoe, so I ordered a pair of Dr Scholls inserts and the boot fits perfect, and with the inserts is very comfortable. Very happy with the purchase.\n",
      "1474 NICE!!!<br /><br />New Balance Men's ML565 Classic Running...\n",
      "1475 These sandals do run about a full size small. Meaning an 11 is really a 10. Other than that they felt great right out of the box and seem to be built well.\n",
      "1476 The boot itself is very comfortable, and thats even without the boot liner socks. To me the boot is a little too high but I bought the boot anyway, because I got tired of waiting for the price to go down.\n",
      "1477 A little too tight  Maybe when I break them in\n",
      "1478 A gift to my sister and she loves it as it's very comfortable!\n",
      "1479 True to size. Daughter says it feels good to her feet. Just wish I had order a size bigger to make shoe last longer.\n",
      "1480 My husband ordered these and LOVES them. He had purchased them and then gave them to a family member that liked them. Then he regretted it and missed them. So he bought this pair. He loves the shoes and I ended up buying a pair in the women's. They are a sturdy shoes but not heavy. Great for hiking but I wear them everywhere.\n",
      "1481 For decades Adidas have set the bar on cool. They look great, feel great, are great. From the courts to the comfort of any other surface, Adidas has got you covered. These shoes are no different. Superstar's are the business. The shell toe is highly fashionable and the rest speaks for itself. I opened the box and smiled. I already knew what to expect. I was just grinning because I got them at such a crazy price. Like around $31 with the discount. I couldn't believe it. Shell toes for that price? Wish I could've gotten more.\n",
      "1482 very nice\n",
      "1483 Wish there were more\n",
      "1484 Great fit. Comfortable and Water resistant. Marvelous shoes\n",

      "1486 The size is a little tight, as other reviews suggest, but they are nice and comfortable if you get one that fits, You may need to go up a size in order to do this.\n",
      "1487 Love Vera Bradley bags. A well constructed bag. However it is a little larger than I like. It does have lots of room for everything. I really appreciate the outter carpartment to hold my tablet. I wish it had another pocket on the other side to put papers.\n",
      "1488 They run large - i wear a 7 - very glad i went with a 6....they fit perfectly.  And - good arch support which is why i bought them.  And - they aren't hideous.\n",
      "1489 My son is very happy with his new cleats.  Very comfortable.\n",
      "1490 Awesome\n",
      "1491 This is a cool bag. It's definitely orange not brown. The leather feels nice though. I hang my bags from the loop at the top and this one came apart after a week. I still love the bag and the store owner was quick to resolve the issue.\n",

      "1504 good\n",
      "1505 Brown color is darker than picture shows (still nice shade though)... Comfy flip flop. (much more comfortable than Soda brand flip flops!! (If you're browsing/comparing). I hv narrow feet - this flip flop was not snug but not loose either; a good balance. The top part and the toe part are pretty soft... Fits true to size. Enjoy! ^_^\n",
      "1506 Stylish and comfortable for rainy day wear, just what I was looking for!\n",

      "1510 Super comphy!\n",
      "1511 While I didn't mind the looks of this shoe, the fit was way off. I got a 9 wide and the toes were fine but the heel was way too loose and the top of the instep was too tight. I'd have to say it was too big AND too small. Very strange. Had to pay return shipping and a restocking fee.\n",
      "1512 I ordered two pair.  Typically, I cannot wear this type of sandal I get a blister or sore between the toes.  This sandal I have walked 3 or more miles in around town on a brisk walk, very comfortable, durable, and soft.  I have scrapped them with our damage and walked in the rain without damage to them.  They fit perfectly and look good on the feet.\n",
      "1513 I love it! Fits and also comfortable. I love the colors of this shoe. I'm glad that I have it.\n",
      "1514 Love this bag!!! So much room!!!! Carrying today...getting a lot of compliments!!!\n",
      "1515 Review questions were about shoes, not a tote.  Didn't  make sense.<br />However, loved the tote but for my use, I exchanged it for a smaller one.  It is sturdy, stands on its own.  There is such a wide variety of sizes and designs.\n",
      "1516 The 6 year old is a big fan.\n",
      "1517 I was looking for walking shoes that are slip-on and these serve the purpose, we are not allowed to wear tennis shoes to work but I go for a 30 minutes walk after lunch every day and I don't want to carry an extra pair of shoes. The description says they are white but they are not, the color of the picture is true. I still want a white pair so I just bought a pair of Sketchers from Amazon, I will write a review on these once I receive and try  to walk in them.\n",

      "1522 This bag does not accord with the picture, not really leather.\n",
      "1523 my daughter has wide feet and it is sometimes difficult to find shoes that have straps to fit. She was able to wear these shoes for 6 months because of the flexibility of the strap. I try to always buy stride rite for my kids due to the high quality. My daughter was able to wear her shoes to day care and they were still nice enough after 6 months of wear and tear to pass on to a friend.\n",
      "1524 Besides being a bit tight, they're well made. I almost sent them back, but for the price, I figured the few hours here and there I'll wear them, they'll be fine.\n",
      "1525 Good product and blue is hard to find.\n",

      "1531 These hiking shoes were awesome...bought them 1 month before 55+ mile back country hiking trip in Yellowstone.  Very little break-in required.  No blisters or hot spots at all  - performed flawlessly - great grip and not clunky like other hiking shoes.  Recommend getting gaiters with low tops if in muddy conditions.\n",
      "1532 Best shoes I've ever owned\n",

I have arthritis in my ankle and these shoes give me great support.  I can walk all day with these shoes on - wore them to Hershey park a couple of weeks ago and they were sooooo comfortable.  this is coming from someone who after 2 hrs of walking I limp if I don't have the right shoes on.  please keep making and selling these!!!!\n",
      "1545 Great sunglasses.  They look amazing.  It has a bigger lens so it looks good if your face is a bit wider.\n",
      "1546 I am disappointed.  Buxton has a reputation for high quality, and I owned my last Heiress wallet for nearly 20 months before buying this one.  Gosh what a difference!  This one just isn't what I expected...cheap thin leather, bad stitching of the zipper to the leather that's already coming out, cheap plastic backing (instead of leather) on the checkbook cover that won't allow its removal from the wallet...the only good thing I can say is that I didn't have to pay full price.  I've been a loyal Buxton customer for nearly 30 years.  If this is what Buxton has sunk to, I may not be back.\n",
      "1547 I have a wide foot.  The fact that they were wider when I first tried them on was not an issue.  I have purchased many pairs of Clarks shoes in the past and will continue to do so!\n",

      "1553 wristlet broke after 2 days\n",
      "1554 BEST SHOES EVER and I'm back to get another pair! I have dead to the floor flat feet and got PF in only one foot (go figure). However the PF is now nearly done after several months of wearing these. I've even gotten to the point where I will get up and walk around without them because the pain is sooo relieved. If you have PF, esp newly diagnosed you won't go  wrong with these. I'd had it for a little while - couple of months-- and upon putting these on and taking a step, I was floored I could walk normally again. I almost had to learn to re-walk since I had been limping. PF usually needs a multi treatment approach, but these should be on your list.\n",
      "1555 One of the best cycling glasses I've had so far. And what you get for the price is the best part of it all. Great packaging and fist class group.\n",

      "1561 The silver coating on the frame pulled off in big flakes just removing the sticky tag on the side.  These are really REALLY cheap sunglasses.  I have seen better in the 5 buck range at grocery stores.\n",
      "1562 spacious and functionable\n",
      "1563 My daughter is the envy of all her classmates. They're better than I expected.\n",
      "1564 This are a lot different than the Billfish boat Lite weight shoe. This shoes sole actually lasts.\n",
      "1565 Took two weeks to receive.  Tried them on, and I could feel the red bands that wrap around the arch of the shoe, just standing.  Walked a few steps, and could feel them then, too.  These are neat looking, the mesh is good on them.  But they won't work for Zumba, or for me, just wearing them.  Size fit was perfect.<br />Requested a refund.  If there's a problem with that, I will update.\n",
      "1566 10's are slightly too big, and 9's are slightly too small. I really wish they would have had 9.5.\n",
      "1567 These were fun for my son, but he outgrew them quickly and was rarely able to wear them. They were sturdy and can be worn with or without the wheels, which came in handy.\n",
      "1568 Not worth it\n",
      "1569 It works great and it looks good.\n",
      "1570 We had to exchange for a larger size.\n",
      "1571 I have these in silver suede and they are soooo comfortable. You can walk in them all day and they go with everything.\n",
      "1572 I have worn them walking and shopping all day and my feet never have gotten tired.  Great product.\n",
      "1573 This was supposed to be a great deal and the original show fit me like a champ.  The problem is that I was sent a size 6 in mens and not the 9.5 I had ordered.  It is a great shoe and super sticky, with a long climbing life... Problem is that it never got used.\n",
      "1574 Have to return, TOO narrow!\n",
      "1575 These a bit snug to my feet for 14s.  the narrow towards the toe and I prefer a wide toe box, so had to send them back.\n",
      "1576 Very happy with purchase! Shipped quickly and a great price!!\n",
      "1577 These are great boots. I used my own orthotics for better support.\n",
      "1578 Super comfy love them 😍😍😍😍\n",
      "1579 They are ok\n",
      "1580 By far the best shoe I've ever worn! Go 1/2 size up. Provides comfort all day. I'm on my feet for 14 hours a day as a nurse, because we all know 12s don't really exist. You won't be sorry if you buy these!!\n",
      "1581 i have not gotten to wear it yet but when i tried it on it felt comfortable and it worked with the dress. i love that i can use a bra that i already have for this because it saves me money and time shopping for the right undergarment.\n",
      "1582 I think the other review was unfair.  It's clearly listed as a mini satchel and so is SMALLER than your standard dome purse.  I bought it for a friend as a birthday present and she thought it was adorable and uses it primarily for evening.  The leather quality is good and the colors are fun.  I'm considering buying one for myself.  It's a cute bag for casual evening events or when you want to carry a little bit more than a wristlet or clutch would hold.\n",
      "1583 Perfect shoe for the beach not too expensive and did a wonderful job will wear them around the house in the pool highly recommend to anyone looking for a water shoe\n",
      "1584 100% quality!\n",
      "1585 I love Keen's!  These are great, and have a dual purpose.  I use them as water shoes also.\n",
      "1586 The threads on the sides of the shoe are kind of visible which makes me think they are not great quality. As for the size, I am a size 8 usually and that's what I ordered and they fit fine on the width but it is a little snug on the length. I will keep you updated on how long they last.  So after using this product for once a week, for almost 9 months, inside a store (do note that this is not much wear compared to my KEDS which I wear everyday in rain) it already has multiple holes, such a waste of money. I suggest you invest in a good quality sneaker.\n",
      "1587 This is not authentic this purse is a fake don't like wont ever order again disappointed extremely\n",
      "1588 These are awesome! Purchased them for my daughter for school and now they are her go to shoe. She says they are super flexible and comfortable. The price was also great. We would purchase again, in fact I think we may get a second pair.\n",
      "1589 I like but it runs big\n",
      "1590 Very narrow. Too tight. Wish i had returned them but wore them for several hours and have already recycled the box. Not at all satisfied with the fit and this is my usual size.\n",
      "1591 Once you get past the dreaded &#34;break-in&#34; of Rainbows, you will never wear any other shoe again. I live in Hawaii and I've worn these every day for a year and they are in EXCELLENT shape. I love love love my rainbows\n",
      "1592 Cute shoes but they run at least two sizes small. I wear a 9 1/2.  Ordered a 10 and gave them to a friend who wears a 9.  She likes them.\n",
      "1593 Great shoes for working on concrete floors, I would recommend them for that type of work.\n",
      "1594 good fit,helps out ,things stay where I put them\n",
      "1595 KIND OF CHEAP. WISH THEY WERE A BIT MORE STURDY BEING THAT THEY ARE KIDS SUNGLASSES\n",
      "1596 There awesome like walking on pillows\n",
      "1597 Cute shoe. Super lightweight, making it a perfect shoe to walk and stand in for hours. No complaints.\n",
      "1598 I love running in these shoes.\n",
      "1599 Great all round shoes\n",
      "1600 It is hard to get the cards out.  Money is a pain to get in and out of.  Looks cool but is annoying and I bought another one finally to replace it.  Probably good for kids.\n",
      "1601 &#34;Slim&#34; cut style really flatters the foot. Hugs the arch nicely for a pretty point unlike other more bulky shoes. They do run a bit small and because the canvas is lighter weight, they wear out faster.  A thicker leather sole would help turning but it's adequate.\n",
      "1602 wore these on a trip to the zoo.  very comfortable.  I didn't experience my usual low back pain from walking all day.\n",
      "1603 These are heavier than any boots I've ever owned, and they're not even boots. But the arch support is good and they are comfortable. I wear a 10.5 and went up to an 11; they go on easily and the liner prevents discomfort from rubbing. These are good for my purpose, which is to walk my dog in wet fields in the morning. Maybe the heavy weight will help build up my legs.\n",
      "1604 My son loves Merrells.\n",
      "1605 insoles will not stay in. when wet they smell bad.\n",
      "1606 They're PERFECT!!!!\n",
      "1607 Comfortable and handsome.\n",
      "1608 Fine!\n",
      "1609 No confortable at all!!\n",
      "1610 Love the comfort of these shoes.  They are adjustable and fit my medium width foot perfectly\n",
      "1611 I love these sandals. I have 3 pair and I wear them all the time.They are very comfortable. I recommend these.\n",
      "1612 arrived right in time, safe package, they look even more adorable than in the picture, classy elegant  they fit perfectly, I am very happy.\n",
      "1613 I have these in black and white.  Love them.\n",
      "1614 A little small but ended up working!!! Love them!!!\n",
      "1615 seem like good quality, buy they are way smaller than expected. I read other reviews suggesting to order large so I went up a size. I should have gone up at least 2, I couldn't even get my foot in... easy return though in case you get the wrong size initially.\n",
      "1616 I grew up in the city of San Clemente, California, where the Rainbow sandals are made! I have worn them since they opened their doors! There is no other sandals made better and with pride! However I do know they have sourced them out which has been very upsetting to me personally but I do encourage you to own at least three pairs you will not be sorry and as for colors they have them all!\n",
      "1617 I was worried these wouldn't be stylish enough to wear every day.  They are so very comfortable.  I love them.\n",
      "1618 adorable\n",
      "1619 The only reason I bought these is so I can touch the ground on my FJR when I stop. Cheap fix for short legs on a tall motorcycle. They fit fine .<br />Larry\n",
      "1620 I loved these shoes when I got them, cute, comfortable and they fit well. I wore them 2 - 3 times a week. Now I've had them 3 months and the gold color is flaking off all over the top and sides. Definitely NOT the kind of quality product that I expect when I buy Sketchers\n",
      "1621 My feet were so painful I had to walk with a cane. I wore these shoes 4 days and was much improved. I could walk without pain.\n",
      "1622 Nice and comfortable fit. Love them!\n",
      "1623 These shoes didn't work out for me. Fit big on my heel and hurt the top of my foot.\n",
      "1624 Very cute just way small! Sent back for a whole size larger hopefully they'll fit. In all very well made and cost seems to be worth the shoe.\n",
      "1625 as always a good basic shoe\n",
      "1626 Perfect size..not to big.  Roomy inside.\n",
      "1627 very good\n",
      "1628 Love them...excellent price and true to size\n",
      "1629 The boots are cute however they wear too easily.  I bought two pairs and each of them the fabric is already wearing off.  I think these would are more of a fashion type of boot...for show only.\n",
      "1630 1. Looks good<br />2. Comfortable<br />3. Offers about as much protection as my expensive polarized Ray Bans and the Oakley's used for almost a month before returning (can't really tell much difference)<br />I certainly highly recommend these.\n",
      "1631 These are for my Great Granddaughter and she loves them.  She's only 4 years old and this is the best I can tell you.  Thank you\n",
      "1632 These are very stylish for those who have a small head and nose bridge.  I struggle to find sunglasses that fit me and don't make me look bug eyed.  I'm very happy with these.\n",
      "1633 Great for the beach or outdoors.\n",
      "1634 Despite my first size choice being a bit small (I'm literally a 7 3/4, and I never know on what size a shoe is going to fall, and the wrap was comfortable (if slightly snug) at the 7.5 size, but I couldn't fit the &#34;flats&#34; part of the shoe on with the wrap on.  I think the 8's will be perfect!<br />Great for anyone doing yoga, or any usually barefoot dance or exercise that requires a bit more grip.  Could also see the wrap as good beam/floor shoes.\n",
      "1635 Great!!!\n",
      "1636 beautiful mules.  I am accustomed to Frye fitting large so ordered a 7.5 to fit my 8.5 feet.  turned out they are pretty much true to size...maybe just a touch large.\n",
      "1637 The size is too small than other models of polo shoes\n",
      "1638 Great!!!!!!!  Very Comfortable and the fit is excellent!\n",
      "1639 Excellent sneakers and great price.\n",
      "1640 I love these shoes!  They are cute and comfortable.  They are also stable with a non-slip rubber textured sole and a nice wide heel.\n",
      "1641 I have had my purse since Aug 12 and I noticed the strap on one side has come in sewed AND its about to break from the gold piece that holds it together! Very disappointed with it ..still love the purse its just broke ALREADY! Refund!?!???\n",
      "1642 Small and narrow although I ordered a larger size. Insoles would not fit.  Sides of the shoe are too soft;  Pretty show though.\n",
      "1643 Excellent! beautiful\n",
      "1644 Too small. I have 4 pairs of shoes and all of them are 8.5 in size. I ordered a 8.5 thinking it would be nice and it was way too small I am waiting for a refund.\n",
      "1645 Glasses are exactly what I wanted  and very flexible as advertised\n",
      "1646 I use arch support insert. This is third pair of these for me. Please keep making them.\n",
      "1647 Very attractive boot, not too heavy which is a pet-peeve of mine. I am a size 9 to 9.5 and ordered a 10 based on the reviews and because half-sizes are not offered. The 10 is too big (heel goes up and down). But with thick socks it does not rub in a painful way. It has not yet rained here so cant comment on effectiveness. I am 5'8 with skinny calves and the boot does come up to about lower to mid-calf on me and does rub slightly. It is a little annoying but if I werent concentrating on the boots I probably wouldnt notice it.\n",
      "1648 Look great. Arrived quickly.\n"

      "1649 Love these shoes. Everything I was looking for. I liked them so much I bought another pair in a different color.\n",
      "1650 My mom loves these. They are the only sandals that don't hurt her feet. She needs good arch support.\n",
      "1651 I absolutely love this bag! I bought it to wear classes at University and it is perfect. It has much more room than i thought it did and it can hold all of my books and stationary. Lovely purchase!\n",
      "1652 It's just what I wanted except the coin section is pretty hard to get into to get coins out.\n",
      "1653 Love, love, love this bag!\n",
      "1654 I like them, but they aren't the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. The style is awesome, though. Just what I was looking for. Discomfort? - a small price to pay for the fashion.\n",
      "1655 Love love love this purse. Got it quick and rarely ever do I switch to a different one. Lots of storage I even use outside gun pocket for my cell phone. This seller was awesome\n",
      "1656 So far so good... Customer service...fantastic\n",
      "1657 I ware size 9 - so I ordered size 9 1/2 thing they would to small - the opposite happen they were to large - I ordered 2 pairs of size 9 and I love these shoes - very comfortable - true to size - and I might order a third pair\n",
      "1658 Bought them 5 years ago, and still using.They are still in great shape.<br />I do not think I will every buy anything other than crocs as slippers. They are very very very comfortable.\n",
      "1659 The glasses where dark enough and covered my eyes. And they came with a bag so that was nice.\n",
      "1660 My 2nd pair of Maui Jim, and it's just as I expected. The clarity of the lenses is second to none, very light weight frame meaning no mark on either side of the bridge of the nose. The arms are not too loose or too tight right out of the box and most importantly, the fit is perfect!<br /><br />I have a small noggin which often gives me difficulty finding sunglasses that fit nicely. Women's sunglasses tend to be a bit small with short arms and men's tend to be too big. I found a happy medium when I switched to Maui Jims a year ago. I have the Maui Jim Waterways which I love but decided to invest in another pair this time opting for one with nonslip silicone nose pads. I researched for about two weeks before finally deciding to pull the trigger on these Kawikas and man they are exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about getting a pair of Maui Jims, I would highly suggest you just man up and get em. I know that the price is a bit high, but trust me, they are worth it. Aside from the excellent quality, Maui Jim has a great selection to choose from.\n",
      "1661 They run small - because of the waterproof gore-tex lining - so I go up 1/2 size ... and have no problem.<br />I have a wide foot - I was wearing a size 9 1/2 4E in New Balance shoes - but since I have switched to Asics I went up a full size to a 10 1/2 in order to have enough width and I go up another 1/2 size when I buy the gore-tex lining.  They do not rub my heel - and are only slightly longer in the toe area.  I love them !!<br />First of all Asics are wonderful - I walk 5 miles a day/5 days a week.  Next - G-TX is wonderful !!!  .... I work in delivery during summer rain - and winter snow ..... these shoes keep you feet warm in the winter and DRY .... and they are not too hot for summer either.  The only reason I haven't purchased them to wear year round was the price .... .but my other Asics have greatly increased in price, making these about the same price - so I may start buying the G-TX year round. .... they are just harder to find to purchase.<br />They have changed the style since 2014 and this style was a little stiffer - took a little time at home to break them in.  First pair of Asics ever that I had to have break-in time.\n",

      "1673 I have several pairs on Vionic sandals. These were too large/too wide for a size 9. A friend who wears a size 11 was able to fit into these shoes. Use caution when purchasing.\n",
      "1674 These run a size too big, had to return them and the smaller size was unavailable, very disappointing for someone with a size 15 foot!!!\n",
      "1675 Really like these shoes first time buying and trying FitFlop shoes and I'm glad I did very well made and pretty I'm normally a 9.5 or 10 in size medium width and after reading helpful reviews for sizing I decided to go with a 9 because it was open toed and foot bed length is good. They stay on your feet effortlessly and are really cushioned and comfortable to walk and stand in. I will defintely buy another pair and style very well made don't get frustrated with sizing once you get the size down their a dream to walk in.\n",
      "1676 Beautiful shoe but I wouldn't recommend if u have small calf's..the straps will not fit snug to your legs\n",

      "1682 Great fit as expected\n",
      "1683 Awesome product.<br /><br />I guess it is true that you do not realize a good thing until it is gone.  I am writing this after trying the new Kahana7, which is a disappointment.<br /><br />This shoe feels extremely comfortable.  I have ran in this shoe on trails, tracks, roads and everything in between.  I average about 40miles a week and I believe this shoe has helped me avoid injury.  I love the way it support the heals and ankles.  Please bring this model back asap!!!!!!\n",
      "1684 They are quite comfortable, I would be in them all day buy not bad for several hours. And they are soft on the soles of the feet.\n",
      "1685 I totally love this produce .. saw great results I only two weeks...\n",
      "1686 Nicely made classic Aviators available in several colors. I have this in the Grey frame/Blue lens, and I like it a lot. My better half, who does not usually like Aviators, likes this pair a lot.<br /><br />The blue lens has a reflective mirror quality, a bit more than the Amazon photo indicated. I don't mind it, but it's sort of a California Highway Patrol look, so don't be surprised.<br /><br />Aviators usually have pretty fragile metal frames, and these are no exception. They come with a soft microfiber bag, but no hard case, so if you'll be packing these in a travel bag you'll want some kind of hard case for them.<br /><br />Lightweight. Comfortable to wear. Good visibility through the lenses. They feel good and look good.<br /><br />Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review. These are the only Aviators I own that my Better Half actually likes the looks of. I'm pleased with them.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful as you comparison shop online. Happy shopping, everybody.\n",
      "1687 As other posters mentioned, the shoe runs small. I have NEVER ordered a size 9 shoe, yet I had to return these and exchange them for a larger size, a hassle. I thought New Balance shoes were more uniformly sized, and that was my previous experience. So when I get a chance to wear the size 9's that I had to get in grey/pink, I will leave a better review as my toes hit the tops of these shoes and I had to exchange them!\n",
      "1688 I have purchased two sets of these boots.  I had serious ankle surgery about 4 years ago and cannot wear heels much anymore.  I gave these a shot because I wanted to have something that looked nice and were also comfortable.  They look great with my work clothes (I'm an attorney) and I have gotten several compliments on them.  I'm a little disappointed with my first pair.  The zipper comes disconnected at the bottom of the zipper and I have to occasionally rework that to get it to zip up.  Also, the right heel came loose and clicks a little when I walk.  I bought the second pair and haven't had any issues at all, but I wish there was something that could be done about that darn heel!  I had them less than a year.\n",
      "1689 I bought these for nursing school. I use them for class and lab. I bought a different paid of shoes for when we do our long clinical days, but these are the most comfortable shoes ever! I love them!\n",

      "1693 Sent back too small.\n",
      "1694 Great arch support however, these shoes need more cushioning overall in the footbed\n",
      "1695 I love the style of these glasses, however, they distort the real color, they make everything look pink instead of green.\n",
      "1696 These are darling!  The material is much nicer than most wellies/rain boots.  They don't make that obnoxious squish sound when you walk in them, they're warm inside and have a nicer supportive insert.  They're lined with something soft, so the material the boot is made of is not flush against your leg.  My feet also don't sweat in these as they do in most rain boots.  The adjustable buckle is ACTUALLY a buckle that adjusts the width of the boot shaft (rather than just a plastic piece of crap that looks cute but does nothing, as it seems to be on most rain boots).  My feet are slightly wide, though not wide enough to wear a wide shoe and these fit great, even with a thick sock.  I'm an athlete and have very strong calves.  No issues fitting them over, even with leggings or skinny pants.  Love the print too! :)\n",
      "1697 I have worn a lot of running shoes over many, many years! For me, New Balance makes the best shoe. These are very comfortable and look great!\n",

      "1702 Awesome shoes!  Just remember you are getting these from China so expect a long delivery time.\n",
      "1703 These shoes were perfect for my trip to Portugal and Spain.  I wore them almost everyday.  The Cobblestones are wicked in Spain but I was not bothered at all with these more stylish than walking shoes.  They gave me enough support and the soles are very sturdy.\n",
      "1704 The sole of both shoes toe came unglued after my third 15+ mile run.\n",
      "1705 They fit and feel great!  Well worth the price\n",
      "1706 Not my most comfortable Vionic shoes. Keeping them but not comfortable enough to wear if doing a lot of walking. The straps over my toes rub. It helped when I tightened the ankle straps. Hopefully they will get better.\n",
      "1707 they are a little bit heavy so that you  hear the steps of your child, but they re comfy for several hours.\n",

      "1714 These shoes look very pretty, but left a blister on the back of my foot the first day of wearing them in the office.  I intended to buy the black color as well when I first received them, but after wearing them I have changed my mind.<br />Size wise they fit true to size, maybe a ted too narrow, but still OK. I wish they were more comfortable.\n",
      "1715 Great shoe. I bought a pair in the past. From another company. Many differnt colors to chose from. Great for walking and running.\n",
      "1716 Awesome shoe!  Very comfortable even w/the height. I am on my feet all day as a teacher & they actually feel good. I even prefer them to a flat. I have a narrow heal, so must wear an insert.\n",
      "1717 All in all a great shoe.  I have bunions so I need wide shoes.  So far Easy Spirit has been the only wide shoe I have found that is actually wide.\n",
      "1718 Great shoe!  I have been wearing them for years!\n",
      "1719 THEY COULD STRENGTHEN THE BOTTOM AND ADD ARCH SUPPORT!\n",
      "1720 I love those shoes. The size I was order is 1 size bigger compare with US size and fit me perfect. Shoes is very elegant, in each shoes lock have a little stone. It's look so beautiful. Bottom of the shoes is have very comfort pad, will help big time if I have to stand or have a long walk. I love it.<br />But my ankle too small to have perfect look in this shoes. I have to use the last hall of shoes halter, then make shoes halter are crooked, and make my ankle look so ugly. But again like I said, that is nothing from the shoes, just because my ankles are too small. So that why I have too bite my toung and return it :( and order one pair similar but no hight halter\n",
      "1721 Great purse with a lot of compartments.\n",
      "1722 Very Pretty\n",
      "1723 Unfortunately they don't come in half sizes. The 7 and 8 both fit as expected, but I really need a 7.5.  No matter, I kept the size 7!  They are super cute, I wear them all the time, and super comfortable.\n",
      "1724 Excellent product . Recommended seller !!\n",
      "1725 They were too big for my face so I returned them however they were nice sunglasses.. Would recommend.\n",
      "1726 Love these sneakers. Have another pair of rosheruns, but these, somehow, are much more comfortable. Highly recommend these!!!!\n",
      "1727 Love these classics! Great shoes for school! Nicer looking than a sneaker but meets all the requirements for sturdy footwear for the playground and gym floors.\n",
      "1728 They are OK for ocassional use\n",
      "1729 good products!\n",
      "1730 Great Boot, Ariat will never let you down!!\n",
      "1731 You can't go wrong with pedipeds!  These look great and fit great and are durable.\n",
      "1732 good product\n",
      "1733 I can't wait to get mine I just ordered black ones! ☺\n",
      "1734 I have been very happy with these boots! As the reviews and info suggested I went up a size and they fit perfect. I've had them for 2 months now and wear daily, anywhere between one-four hours each day. They are starting to crack in some spots from wear, so no longer water proof as I found when I stepped into a river but still perfectly usable for work around our farms and chicken coop. I love the prints and since they are so inexpensive I plan to buy more!\n",
      "1735 Great  pair of shoes my daughter loves them . Thank you for making the purchase as painless as possible.  I'll tell everyone about these shoes.\n",
      "1736 Very cheap looking and poor quality fabric.\n",
      "1737 It's more dressier looking than most Ecco shoes. These will go well with my suits.\n",
      "1738 I love them. I bought them but not sure I would wear them very long. I had them on last night for about 4 hours. That was fine. No problem These are absolutely gorgeous!!!\n",
      "1739 This is only shoes I can ware to walk all day\n",
      "1740 Great\n",
      "1741 So glad I bought these.\n",
      "1742 I bought these years ago not from Amazon but another source.  They used to be wonderful as the first review on here says.  I bought them a second time and now they are as the second reviewer notes.  In other words they are cheaply made foreign junk.  Buyer beware.  Also the picture is deceiving as the heels do not come up over your heels.  They slip off your feet and come apart in a minute.  Garbage.\n",
      "1743 I knew before I bought them that I needed a size smaller than I normally wear in a croc. They are definitely not sized the same.\n",
      "1744 They were the right size and they are evey comfortable.\n",
      "1745 Really good value for the price. The sole is somewhat stiff to me, but thats probably only because I'm used to running shoes with air sole. The leather is pretty thin though, easily wetted by rain. However, the style is great, love the color, and worth the price.\n",
      "1746 Great deal!  It would've been nice to have more men's and not so many ladies.  Awesome price for what you get\n",
      "1747 Good looking, comfortable glasses for tennis.\n",
      "1748 UPDATE: Hiked the Grand Canyon last month and they were perfect!  Great support and comfort.  I suffered from tired legs but my feet didn't hurt at all.  This is a no-brainer purchase.  Do it...<br /><br />Only took one hike so far in these but it was great.  Very supportive and great traction.  I've always been a Timberland fan and these don't disappoint.\n",
      "1749 Based on the comments, I ordered a half a size up and it was perfect (I'm normally US 7.5 - 8 and I ordered a US 8.5).<br />The shoes are very comfortable and they look fantastic.\n",
      "1750 Glasses met expectations - use them for car driving, cycling and general outdoors use\n",
      "1751 Great for wedding after you take off the heels\n",
      "1752 These bedroom shoes are great! .This is the 3rd pair I've purchased, one for me and gifts for others.  The support is so much better than your average bedroom shoes and this is the prettiest shade of light pink!  The price from this seller was terrific and the shipment came through without any issues and before the promised deadline.\n",
      "1753 Original pair ran small, exchanged for larger very expeditiously, good service by supplier\n",
      "1754 Bought this bag at TJMaxx for $10.00. I bought this bag for organization for my large Whipping Post Tote.  Coin purse is big enough to use a wallet for my Dave Ramsey Cash envelope system with come index dividers and I am using a Vera Bradley coin purse. Love that I can have a smaller bag in my tote for when I just need to run into a gas store etc and not have to take my huge tote in!\n",
      "1755 I can see\n",
      "1756 Super  Light!\n",
      "1757 Kind of provides a little arch support.\n",
      "1758 Nice, comfortable.\n",
      "1759 Comfort\n",
      "1760 Everytime I wear these light weight shoes I receive compliments, they are much prettier than the photo.  I ordered the Bronze, they seem to go with everything I wear.  They feel like I am wearing slippers - the soles give grip control that I can walk down a very steep driveway which I did not dare walk even with hiking boots.  I lucked out to get on a lightening sale for $24.99 and really enjoy them.\n",
      "1761 These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  No break-in time required.  Comfortable right out of the box.  Could be on my feet all day with comfort.\n",
      "1762 My son loves this shoe and purchased a second pair because they are so comfortable.\n",
      "1763 Love the shoes.  Very pretty, but also very comfortable.  Goes with shorts, skirts, pretty much anything.\n",
      "1764 The ends of the laces are too thick to fit into one of the pairs of shoes I wanted to lace. Have to use these with a different pair of shoes. I wish 40&#34; were available. These are too long at 45&#34;, but the next length down would have been too short.\n",
      "1765 Very nice color to go with a lot of pastel clothing.  The only caveat I had with this particular slip-on was that the back of the heels needed to be broken in as it was a little stiff at first.\n",
      "1766 These shoes are really comfortable for my wide, flat feet. I spend around 12 to 16 hours on my feet a day, so comfort and support are absolutely necessary. These shoes really deliver. They are not quite as roomy in the toe as my old Brooks shoes. But since Brooks changed their sizing, these have served in their place. I'm taking off one star because for some reason, these shoes squeak like crazy. My patients know when I am coming because they can hear the soles of these shoes squeaking all the way down the hall. I have tried all the tricks I've found online and nothing seems to help. Carpet, linoleum, concrete, or wood... It does not matter. These shoes are loud! I've had them for about five months and worn them at least five days a week since receiving them. It's not the worst thing ever, though. I've learned to deal with it.\n",
      "1767 Beautiful Shoe! Relatively comfortable. Fits well. Foot feels secure in these. While still being sexy. True to size.\n",
      "1768 Has a large capacity for cards is easy to get into. Doesn't take up a lot of room in your purse.\n",
      "1769 I purchased shoes for dual purpose: river crossings and camp shoes for backpacking.  I took liners out to make them lighter.  They are super lightweight and worked great in river and on land.  A bit wide without insert, but I have wide feet so it was no problem.  I like that they can be cinched down for a more snug fit crossing rivers.\n",
      "1770 I ordered these sunglasses because my Ray Ban's just like these got lost. I did not want to pay another $200 so I decided to try these out, and I absolutely love them! So fashionable and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this product to anybody.\n",
      "1771 Love this bag!\n",
      "1772 I have three other pairs of KEEN shoes - one other sandal. This is considerably narrower and ... what? ... shorter? The distance from the bottom of my foot to the top of my foot is sorely squished in these, as is the width of my foot. All my other KEEN shoes and sandals are delightfully comfortable, and are my chosen shoe if I'm going to be on my feet for hours. These almost killed me at a music festival.\n",
      "1773 Good but a little short for the size\n",
      "1774 Super comfortable.  Love these boots!\n",
      "1775 Bought during 50% off. Great deal and quality boat shoe.\n",
      "1776 my granddaughter loved it\n",
      "1777 These shoes run large.  I read the previous reviews and bought it half a size smaller than I normally wear.  They came and were slightly to big but I had bought them to wear to an event that was the next day.  Wore them that evening and they stretched and are now way to big for me.  Its to bad because I really like the shoe and would wear them if they fit.  Buy them small and give yourself the chance to exchange is they don't fit.\n",
      "1778 I wish they made prettier shoes w/ this wonderful support.\n",
      "1779 So cute!!! I loved the color, very girly but won't get dirty quickly. I always swore by brooks for running but these are my new favorite. My second pair. You should buy these!!!\n",
      "1780 I love the look of these shoes and the way they fit.  Was disappointed in the memory foam inside the shoe.  I guess I expected it to be more of the memory foam.  I stand on my feet all day and walk in them.  But I will add some more memory foam.  I ordered a half size bigger than I normally wear, based on the reviews I saw before I ordered.  I like to wear thick fluffy socks in the winter and I think these will allow them.\n",
      "1781 Is good but too large\n",
      "1782 These are great for anyone who struggles to get laces tied or keep them tied.  Easy to install.  Good product.\n",
      "1783 These sandals are perfect for pedicures.  They keep the toes comfortably separated and are sturdy enough to walk in outside.\n",
      "1784 Love them\n",
      "1785 Would have been great but it ran that little bit too small\n",
      "1786 I am returning.\n",
      "1787 I have big feet so the narrow toe box in Nike are not for me.\n",
      "1788 unfortunately this pair had a manufacturing defect and had to be returned which sports hub handled gracefully and a full refund was issued. I purchased the same shoes in the past however and juat loved them!!\n",
      "1789 so pretty . i love my sneakers\n",
      "1790 liked them a lot, and will be buying more.\n",
      "1791 They are more beautiful than in the picture and are very comfortable!\n",
      "1792 These shoes are stylish and comfortable.  A big gold star for Jambu.\n",
      "1793 Great pair of boots.\n",
      "1794 These are wonderfully comfortable shoes, nice modest heel, being 5'9, I need to keep the heel height to a minimum and these don't make feel like a giant:). Very attractive, can be worn with slacks or dresses - winner:). I ordered the black lizard and the navy blue.\n",
      "1795 The band around the top was extremely uncomfortable.  They have already been returned as unwearable.\n",
      "1796 My daughter loves these.\n",
      "1797 Cool concept! Little difficult getting in and out of for me though. Kept it though cuz i do love it\n",
      "1798 Gorgeous purse. My wife loves it. Seems to be well made and looks beautiful, if you like beaded bags.\n",
      "1799 Nice pair of flip flops\n",
      "1800 cool\n",
      "1801 I love these shoes, great for lifting, squats, deadlifts, pretty much anything to do with the barbell.\n",
      "1802 Came a day earlier than stated, which is always nice. Product as expected. Started wearing them right away. They are correct size, etc.  I normally wear a 10 1/2, but noted from another reviewer who wears the same size, to order a 10 and they would fit perfectly. So I did, and they did.\n",
      "1803 Definitely my favorite shoes I've worn. Fits perfectly out of the box and these shoes last for a long time.\n",
      "1804 Fotos fine as long you morder half size larger tan usual...<br />As forma the resto, excellent...\n",
      "1805 I'm between an 8 -9. I needed the 40. 39 just a little small. Best sandal I've ever had!!! So comfortable. Love them\n",
      "1806 Great all around shoe - good for work!  Haven't worn them for long period of time yet so not sure on the all day comfort.  Nicely finished on the inside.  Fit true to size!\n",
      "1807 Bought my first pair of these at a running store and paid twice as much.  So when I needed a new pair I checked in with Amazon, and there they were (with 20% off to boot)!  Comfortable and wears well.  Will probably stick with this line next time I need a running shoe.\n",
      "1808 Great style, nice materials, poor fit.\n",
      "1809 Comfortable and classic.  This is my second pair and I have  found them to be a very comfortable walking shoe. Great for travel.  I have waked all over European cities in them.  The versatile, classic style works well with skirts, slacks, jeans, ----- from farmers markets to the opera.  Light weight for packing is a plus!  I have high arches so I can't say they provide good arch support for me, but they may for others.  My feet are never sore at the end or the day. I will buy them as long as they make them!\n",
      "1810 I bought 2 pair of Hot Chocolate Design shoes in size 6.  These flats are roomy and fairly comfortable.  The heels were tight and too small.  I just love the designs though.\n",
      "1811 Perfect for casual fit!!<br />I love it!!!\n",
      "1812 Most comfortable sandals I've ever wore, and this coming from someone who has sensitive feet.\n",
      "1813 Good shoe for the price\n",
      "1814 Very comfortable shoes\n",
      "1815 No problems with product or vendor.\n",
      "1816 Great pair of boots. Great fit and quality.\n",
      "1817 Was worried bc of the reviews, but these are perfect. Wore them straight out of the box on a hiking trip. Comfortable and fit perfect. I normally wear thick socks to get the roll down effect, but these don't need em. Matches everything and they look FANTASTIC with leggings.\n",
      "1818 I bought these boots for early season hunting as well as hiking. I like the fact that they were Gore-Tex and very lightweight. I wore them on a recent trip to Glacier National Park, where I hiked 35 miles in 2.5 days, and these boots were excellent! I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a breathable, lightweight hiking/hunting boot. The ankle support is excellent as well. The only thing I could possibly gripe about is that these do seem to run a smidge narrow. My feet are somewhat wide, and these still fit great, but were a bit snug. Perhaps that's what you want in a good hiking boot though, as it provides more support.\n",
      "1819 THANK SO MUCH I SUFFER FROM DIABETIC NEUROPATHY AND THIS TYPE OF SHOES WORKS WELL FOR ME. DANNY.\n",
      "1820 Great price for a beautiful boot\n",
      "1821 Actually I wear a size 9M so I should expect them to be too small. With this shoe 9.5 fits the best, even size 9 is not comfortable. I LOVE THESE SHOES THOUGH!!!!! If you can order a half size up, you would have a good fit, probably because of the pointed toes. The shoe is GORGEOUS and the heel height is perfect for wearing with ankle pants and skinny jeans.\n",
      "1822 A little large for my size 10 feet but very comfortable\n",
      "1823 like them\n",
      "1824 Everything ok\n",
      "1825 I've never had a 'tennis shoe' boot before, and LOVE this pair! They provide awesome support, yet are light weight enough that I can wear these all day (and I have) with ZERO straining issues on my knees. They are comfortable, yet rugged. Recommend.  :)\n",
      "1826 Love Clark's sandals.\n",
      "1827 They are great! Good price + really great service!<br />Thank you\n",
      "1828 I like the shoes\n",
      "1829 I've been trying to get ahold of sneaker star for a week now to exchange my shoes for a pair of one's that are a half size bigger. No response. I need an address to send the shoes back so I can exchange them for a half size larger but I can't get an email back.\n",
      "1830 Looks exactly as it does in the picture. Great size and great quality!\n",
      "1831 Great! Fits perfectly. She has narrow feet though. I don't think people with wide feet would find them as comfortable.\n",
      "1832 No more than what I expected. Bottom is a bit mor slippery than I'd like it though. Fast shipping. Worth it.\n",
      "1833 I love these shoes! I got the black leather ones. The size, style, fit, color, and description is exactly what I received! I was intrigued by the low cut above the toes. It is not your usual coverage of the entire toe area: the crevice between big toe and next one peeks out. I think that looks great! The straps above the ankle fit well. I plan on getting another pair in a different color. I am very pleased with these shoes and would highly recommend.\n",
      "1834 Love them I bought my mom a pair to she loves hers\n",
      "1835 Strap shorter than expected\n",
      "1836 Love these Sandals!! I think Jesus, would have loved them too! 😊👍🏽\n",
      "1837 they were perfect!\n",
      "1838 The reading glasses fit just right. They actually look and wear with comfort.\n",
      "1839 Loved this pump, perfect for a formal night out, even prettier in person.\n",
      "1840 love keens - last for kids!\n",
      "1841 Great\n",
      "1842 Two narrow in the foot, to wide in the heal, i just need laces on my shoes.\n",
      "1843 It was my fault.  I didn't read that they were women's boots.  I ordered and of course fit too small.\n",
      "1844 These are my favorite shoes in the world!  Naturalizers seem to fit my wide feet well, and these are so comfortable and give good support.  I need a casual shoe that doesn't look too &quot;clunky&quot;. I don't like pointy toes and I don't like rounded toes that look like a clown's shoe. These are perfect.  I got my first pair fitted at a shoe store, and when I ordered another pair online I was pleased that the fit and quality were the same.\n",
      "1845 Bought sz 3 for my 7.5 yr old, fits great.\n",
      "1846 Didn't fit well.\n",
      "1847 LOVE IT\n",
      "1848 I love the shoe but it was too narrow!  Had to return.\n",
      "1849 Fits as expected and keeps my daughter's feet dry.\n",
      "1850 Do not order these online, as the size is not accurate.\n",
      "1851 I needed more something that had better cushioning and they do not provide it.\n",
      "1852 I have worn mine for the past 4 winters.....I need new ones but sadly it seems they are no longer available.\n",
      "1853 I have narrow feet and I have trouble finding shoes to fit.  Naturalizer used to be the brand I turned to but they don't work anymore.  I was hoping these shoes listed as AA width would fit because I like the design.  But they just don't fit even when I insert innersoles.  I am dissappointed<br />that I have to return them.\n",
      "1854 So small\n",
      "1855 Second pair of Gel-Noosa shoes.  Love them!\n",
      "1856 Love it!\n",
      "1857 My son picked these as his school shoes\n",
      "1858 Absolutely love the look. I am a size 5.5 or 6, and boy am I  glad that I ordered a 6. They are the the correct length, but so narrow that my feet are nearly falling asleep ... I mean they are so tight - and I have normal/ slightly narrow feet! To compensate, I would highly suggest a half size larger than normal (though I don't know how much that would even help... I mean these guys are crazy narrow). My hope and guess is that after a few weeks of wear they'll stretch.\n",
      "1859 Bad quality ans size z really big... :/\n",
      "1860 Item was as described and shipped A S A P.  Great seller!\n",
      "1861 Excellent Quality ...\n",
      "1862 I love this sandals, beautiful and comfortable!\n",
      "1863 Tried to return this shoe was hardest thing.\n",
      "1864 good pair of shoes. my girlfriend loves it\n",
      "1865 Ok\n",
      "1866 i wear them all day on concrete floor standing, with my othropedic inserts\n",
      "1867 Such a great shoe and I got it at a steal. I know NW shoes run narrow, so I went up half a size, but now it's a little too long as they've stretched with wear (nothing that heel grips wont fix) They did scuff easily though\n",
      "1868 The bag came earlier than i expected and so far its pretty great. The quality is nice and i love the style :)\n",
      "1869 As expected but a little large\n",
      "1870 Nice and comphy shoe. Looks good and can be used for light hiking.\n",
      "1871 Fabulous shoe. Even on my first day of wearing, no points where I feel uncomfortable or pain. The strap around the ankle area is very comfortable, giving stability without constraint. I am tempted to order more pairs in case they are ever discontinued. I travel a lot overseas and these are going with me.\n",
      "1872 Great\n",
      "1873 Came apart too easily.\n",
      "1874 I ordered a size 11 US, because I own other Clark's dress shoes. These are way too long! I am returning and ordering a size 10 US to replace them. Otherwise, they look great and are comfortable.\n",
      "1875 As expected.  Good looking shoe.\n",
      "1876 I wear these in my studio during the summer months when it's too hot for boots. The floors are concrete, and these shoes have been comfortable for months. I don't expect them to last longer than a year, but for the price and what I put them through, I am more than happy with this purchase.\n",
      "1877 Nice\n",
      "1878 I just love these things! So easy to put on and put away. light weight. doesn't hurt my nose. I do forget they are on. But, I'm kind of stuck between the 1.5 and 2.0 strengths. I have one of each now and will continue to experiment until I decide which I want. Then I will buy one for each room in the house and one in the car and one in the purse. Then I'll have replaced all the regular readers with something I like. I will get each color too. I was thinking that I would like them to be &#34;shorter&#34; up and down length of the lens. Just a bit. But now with the 1.5 strength, the size seems just right. I'll probably stick with the 1.5 strength for the rest of the ones I buy.\n",
      "1879 LOvE Sanuks. Fit true to size. COMFY!!!\n",
      "1880 Beautiful. Packaged to lay flat, but shapes up so perfectly upon opening package.\n",
      "1881 The shoes is awesome and the size fits very well.\n",
      "1882 The brown polish doesn't hold up to a 5 year old boy\n",
      "1883 The boot is sewen wrong so your foot cannot fit into it!\n",
      "1884 I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the product for the price. The pleather is actually very supple and smooth and did not look cheap. Though I wore these all day as a bridesmaid, they were not initially comfortable. The heel is very hard but the addition of some cheap, clear insoles made the shoes much more comfortable.  Also, the flat gold flat fake &#34;clasp&#34; that holds the chain hook hit right on the outside of my ankle bones. That area was slightly bruised the next day after 8+ hours of wear. If you are wearing a long dress with these shoes, prepare for snagging. The clasp/chain snagged on the thule of my dress several times while sitting down thankfully I did not see any tears.<br /><br />Overall, the quality was better than I expected and for the price the shoe lasted me through a wedding and will be worn again for special occasions. Definitely plan to buy a pair of insoles.\n",
      "1885 Barely fitted on my feet.\n",
      "1886 appeared larger than it is; very cute; however  VERY small.\n",
      "1887 Great looking rain boots at a great price.  He hasn't worn them in inclement weather yet, but unless they leak, I'd say they're well worth the money.\n",
      "1888 Love the shoes!!!\n",
      "1889 Excellent gym shoe.  Good with weight lifting, good for cross training.  Excellent arch support.\n",
      "1890 Awesome boots for the price! Quality construction and materials.<br /><br />Great for gardening and rainy outdoor activities. Ample room to tuck pants inside.<br /><br />My only complaint is that size 8 runs a tad larger than expected. If you normally wear 8s, I suggest going down at least 1/2 a size on these.\n",
      "1891 Uncomfortable\n",
      "1892 Love these shoes...so very comfortable, right from the very first step!  It would be lovely if the straps were a bit longer.  I also wish that all colors were the same price.  I really, really wanted these in black but that color was 20+ dollars more then this purple and one other color.  I'll be danged if I was going to pay that much more for the same shoe.  For that I only giving it 4 stars.\n",
      "1893 I had one pair that was too small so I ordered one size up. That helped, but they still rub. They are just too pricey to not be more comfortable.\n",
      "1894 These are awsome sauce!! Very much what I expected and the price amazing.\n",
      "1895 Good support, comfortable, well made, worth the money.  No quibbles..\n",
      "1896 Love the Jambus and the red is so pretty. This is my replacement pair as I have about worn out my last pair. The deal on this pair from Amazon was too good to pass up. They arrived perfectly wrapped. Thank you!!\n",
      "1897 First time since 2012 I've found running shoes that work for me. Only reason I did not give them a &#34;5 star&#34; is based on the color. Their orange/black looks more like fluorescent pink/black.\n",
      "1898 It came very quickly and I absolutely love it! Best product I have purchased off of amazon so far!\n",
      "1899 I received these glasses very quickly!  I love them.  they fit my face and look - received many compliments.<br />just wish they came with a case - oh well!!<br />Tova\n",
      "1900 Perfect\n",
      "1901 Awesome fit and looks great!\n",
      "1902 Love the shoes\n",
      "1903 My son likes this.\n",
      "1904 😊😊\n",
      "1905 Not all that but style was pretty cool, quality wise you get what you pay for.\n",
      "1906 need to order these flip-flops one size larger\n",
      "1907 Ray ban always delivers the best!\n",
      "1908 Love them. I get compliment when I wear them. So cute.\n",
      "1909 The faux leather peels off very easily\n",
      "1910 I used to have a pair like these and was so excited when I saw them. they arrived 2 weeks before they were suppose to, and fit very nicely. They were so comfortable I was able to walk all day in them.\n",
      "1911 I walked around the house with these boots on and the heel doesn't feel as high as it looks. I was surprised, in a good way.\n",
      "1912 Love it\n",
      "1913 I loved him unfortunately they're too small for my big head :)<br />So I have to return them even though I like them\n",
      "1914 They look nice but are very uncomfortable if you have to walk any notable distance. I ran in them for only 500 feet to catch a plane and they tore up my heels to the point that they were bleeding.\n",
      "1915 I travelled with this less than half a dozen times and now the retractable multistage wheel handle has become stuck and unusable.  The time this occurred I was about to pass through airport security to board a flight and had to hammer it in to retract it before I could place it on the x-ray conveyor belt.  The laptop sleeve buried at the bottom is also not a good idea as every time I pass through airport security I have to dig my laptop out from a pile of clothing.\n",
      "1916 Great shoes, not great for walking though. Don't wear if your planning on being on your feet for a long period of time.\n",
      "1917 I ordered the wrong size. I did try them on, and they were extremely comfy. Cute, too.\n",
      "1918 Love my bag! I get lots of compliments on it.\n",
      "1919 GOOD QUALITY , GOOD DELIVERY\n",
      "1920 I have about 250 miles on these shoes and they're holding up O.K. I buy Newtons half a size larger than a Nike and that seems about right.\n",
      "1921 muy buen producto\n",
      "1922 Excellent , comfortable shoe!!!\n",
      "1923 My son wears a size 3.5. I bought these for school (which starts tomorrow), but these are extremely large compared to the stated size. However, they are really nicely made. I plan to order him a smaller size and just keep the bigger ones for later :)\n",
      "1924 I just received my boots today it came a day early and they look just like the picture omg they are so cute perfect fit enough room for when i wear thick socks I love them and i can not wait to wear them\n",
      "1925 Love these shoes bought in 2 different colors!  I didn't expect their to be arch support but if you are looking for that these are not the right show!\n",
      "1926 this is my third pair, i love it very comfortable.  i even wear it on my days off.\n",
      "1927 I LOVE THEM.  I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT A GOOD DEAL I WAS GETTING.  I WEAR THEM ONLY IN THE HOUSE.  YOU, HOWEVER COULD WEAR THEM ANYWHERE.\n",
      "1928 No joke,man,if you know how to use it<br />this stuff will make your leather gear shine.<br />This has been my preferred polish going<br />on forty five years.<br />I've seen reviews by people who freaked out<br />when the polish arrived cracked,off color etc,<br />Never happened to me,but,if it happens to<br />you don't panic and don't start it on fire or<br />you'll vaporize essential oils.<br />Just take off the lid and warm the polish in the<br />the can by sunshine,hair dryer,hot water etc.<br />Remember,warm the can not the polish.\n",
      "1929 The boots were beautiful. The length was perfect. However, the top of the shoe, at the base of the lashes was so tight I could barely stand it. I have a high arch, but I have never had a boot fit so tightly on the top of my foot. Broke my heart to return them.\n",
      "1930 These shoes were very cute, but also very uncomfortable. I could only wear them for maybe an hour and that was after I got get inserts for them.\n",
      "1931 Excellent shoes to wear\n",
      "1932 Fast shipping! Awesome shoes!\n",
      "1933 Very nice shoes\n",
      "1934 Good\n",
      "1935 Very good boost\n",
      "1936 The item does not fit like Havanas you buy from the actual store the straps are big.\n",
      "1937 So far these shoes are great, however, I rarely find shoes with enough arch support for me, these are no exception.\n",
      "1938 This small wallet holds much and is a perfect size to fit in any bag I own. Love it.\n",
      "1939 Wish they were a little wider\n",
      "1940 The shoes started out comfortable.<br /><br />But they are not all meant to wear anywhere near a beach shoes.  I got sand in them and decided to wash them on a light wash in washing machine and the tore up\n",
      "1941 Love, Love, LOVE these boots.  They are def one of my FAVOURITE of all times.  I do body work and wear these for 8-13 hours straight doing massage.  I was shocked that they are so comfortable.  I've had them re-soled twice since the blacks are out of stock.  I bought both colours.  Great buy!!!\n",
      "1942 Love 'em, just love, love, love 'em. So very comfortable and unlike the traditional flops!! Get u a pair or two!!\n",
      "1943 Lightweight shoe\n",
      "1944 Yep, muted fall colors that will go with everything.<br />Yep, feels sturdy with reasonable construction.<br />Yep, medium bag will hold iPad and more.<br />Yep, I think it's unisex.<br /><br />I'll get good use from this bag, taking it with me for appointments where I have to wait (doctors, dentists). I think students will find it handy for holding supplies and a book or two. I carry small purses which will fit in the medium bag.\n",
      "1945 These shoes look great but don't feel that great. The length is as expected but they run narrow. The left show also fits a bit high on my heel and rubs a sore spot.\n",
      "1946 Perfect for dressy wear.\n",
      "1947 The toe box of these shoes turn up like a clowns or a jester shoe... They are being returned, obviously Easy Spirit has seen fit to<br />sell a defective product... These are dangerous.\n",
      "1948 Love them. I just havn't had the chance to really wear them yet.\n",
      "1949 These are from heaven!  They're comfortable and I feel super stylish in them.\n",
      "1950 Comfortable and elegant pair of shoes. I love J.D. Fisk shoes.\n",
      "1951 So comfy and cute. When on, they have a bit of a beatnik look that I really enjoy. They are very comfortable--I'm a teacher so I'm on my feet a lot, and I can wear these all day long. They go with everything and were very affordable\n",
      "1952 I am very excited in regards to the Vera Bradley backpack!  I got it because there are times I have to go to the doctor or on errands with my husband who has Parkinson's and is in a wheelchair.  My purse would constantly slip off the shoulder but now I can put the stuff in the backpack and on my back without the constant slipping I now experience.\n",
      "1953 Item was as described and shipped A S A P. Great seller!<br /><br />These are the coolest most comfy shoes I have ever owned. They are great for walking and standing long periods of time. The mesh material is cool and they are machine washable.\n",
      "1954 I bought them for winter, so haven't worn them yet, but they seem extremely comfortable. Good arch support and a high padded collar which provides good ankle support. They also look good. Think they will be perfect for winter traveling and walking in wet, cold weather. They are also surprisingly lightweight.\n",
      "1955 They're OK, but I had another pair by Jambu that I LOVED and these do not compare.\n",
      "1956 Got these when I made a goal to start running.  They have held up pretty well and are turning out to be a great shoe.\n",
      "1957 Awesome\n",
      "1958 Very comfortable.  Order a half of size larger nd firs perfect.\n",
      "1959 Beautiful and I got many compliments\n",
      "1960 This purse was great until the bottom metal part started cutting through the lining on the bottom inside. It is either the clip holding the seatbelt together or maybe the clip holding the feet on the bottom of the purse. I was told by this company they were going to replace my purse and I sent them my information and then I never heard another word from them.<br />Be careful. I get lots of compliments on this purse from men and women. Too bad it isn't lasting very long.\n",
      "1961 Bought for wife. Light and strappy like a sandal<br />Comfy and supportive like a shoe\n",
      "1962 Great sandle, will buy again!!\n",
      "1963 Beautiful shoes\n",
      "1964 Perfect\n",
      "1965 Well the supra shoes was too small. I'll to pre order another shoes of this to try again. Thank you.\n",
      "1966 The sandals are very very comfortable! I wear a size six and a half and they fit me perfectly so if you are a size 7 I would recommend going up to a size 8 as they would be too small for you otherwise.\n",
      "1967 Great size. Nice design and quality.\n",
      "1968 Beautiful bag! However, I thought I was receiving the one pictured. Would be nice to let people know that they will not receive the one in the photo.\n",
      "1969 My daughter just love them/\n",
      "1970 Good shoe! I am so used to things being narrower than expected, I went to the 4E, which was a little wide for me.<br />Not so wide, i could not wear them, but wider than i'd like if I ran alot.<br />Again not Asics fault, I ordered them.  They seem true to size & are very lightweight.\n",
      "1971 Great running shoes... reqady for the next 400 miles !!\n",
      "1972 Nice sturdy white framed sunglasses. I used them for a stage production and they did the job!\n",
      "1973 I switched from Footjoy golf shoes to these skechers.  They took a few rounds to break in but once they did they are immensely comfortable.  The support is slightly less than my footjoys, but i like to wear my shoes a little loose anyway.  I have played about 40 rounds in them and they are holding up really well.  I use a little vinyl/leather conditioner to ocassionally clean them up.  Love these shoes and would definitely recommend a try for anyone considering them.\n",
      "1974 I returned for credit the wide width was still too narrow. I always fit in a &#34;standard&#34; wide width\n",
      "1975 Love these.  It took forever to find a pair of shoes I liked, but these were perfect!  So happy with these shoes.\n",
      "1976 Compfy.  Durable.  Cute.\n",
      "1977 Love them!\n",
      "1978 Fit was great, unfortunately after on outing they were scratched and the material at the top peeled right off. No longer presentable for school...very disappointed\n",
      "1979 Loved the show. Fearful about zipper quality.\n",
      "1980 I love these. I have wide feet and by the end of the day these can feel a little too narrow, but overall they are really comfortable. I love that they are minimalist shoes because I feel so comfortable and the next best thing to barefoot. I work in an elementary school and I'm either walking a lot or sitting on the floor, these shoes are great for both. I love the grey because it's goes with pretty much everything.\n",
      "1981 Okay and get the job done, but they will last only one season. Cute, comfy and my boys loved them, but the inserts at the bottom on the insoles started falling out after a couple wears and the tie on the back started to fray.\n",
      "1982 Pretty good quality for the price,  but shoes run really narrow!\n",
      "1983 These shoes look great and seem well made. I ordered my normal size as I have owned many pairs of Asics. They're basically the only sneakers I buy. These were much narrower than Asics usually are. They rubbed the side of my foot raw. Unfortunately I had to return.\n",
      "1984 These shoes were way too small. I ordered a size 7 and they may have fit a size 5.\n",
      "1985 soft comfy in general great\n",
      "1986 This kind fine, no problem\n",
      "1987 Like the retro look & feel of these shoes.  Light and comfortable on my feet.\n",
      "1988 Like the shoes. Haven't really worn them much yet. Will accommodate socks for winter.\n",
      "1989 My daughter loves these shoes--absolutely no complaints!\n",
      "1990 Fit as others I have purchased\n",
      "1991 These are heavy shoes.  My former shoes were Red Wing and quite a lot lighter.<br />Wore these all day the first day with no sore spots.  Does rub a bit on the Achilles, they are higher in the back than I am used to.\n",
      "1992 These are great. I'm a bit of a chuck taylor fanatic but these are much better than chucks. They are more comfortable, in my opinion better looking, better built and more durable than chucks. The tounge is flimsy just like chucks which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on preference. I get tons of compliments on these shoes. I like them alot.\n",
      "1993 Love these shoes, so comfortable and fit perfect!\n",
      "1994 Bought these in size 8C, my feet swell or grew since I turned 60.  First, they are awesome looking, a beautiful shoe.  However they are tight thru the toes and the heels are a solid 3&#34; and a bit higher than I wanted for my bad back.  Did I mention beautiful, I love their look!  I wanted to order them in navy or even red but my first pair were $25, and now they are $40 to $60.  Yikes!  I hope when I wear them over 5 minutes, I can say they are comfy.  The larger diameter heel I hope will make me steady on my feet and help the comfort.  I'll add an additional note if they are more comfortable in the wearing at an event.<br />Striking shoe, I was very amazed.\n",
      "1995 excellent\n",
      "1996 Bought these for my husband who has a super high arch and a wide foot. They fit mostly as expected and he can wear them comfortably . I really like the shoes.<br />I do wish that they would make the z strap for men\n",
      "1997 I really like this sandals, but they don't fit,  a little too small.so I really don't know what to do with it. So I gave it to a homeless person in the Street.\n",
      "1998 Been buying these shoes for years. Fits great and last a long time.\n",

      "Do not buy: really didn't start to wear them until May of 2016. Junk, they are falling apart. The outer sole is so thin that although I wear them almost completely in the house on rugs the inner padding is showing through in the heel. My previous pair from the same company lasted 5 years before I threw them out.  I'm sorry I didn't wear them more often when I first got them as I would have returned them immediately\n",

      "Ok, I have been searching for shoes to replace the shoes I used to wear but are now too crazy expensive. (wanna guess?) I am so happy with these, I did get them on sale, which helped me a lot, but honestly, these are truly worth more. The\\y are so comfortable, the arch is awesome, the cushioning, which is my number one issue (fat woman, 35 years working intensive care) is amazing. I love that the tongue is super thin and doesn't get in the way. I love the lacing system, but i needed a little more room in the shoe, some days it works great, other days i wish i just had one more inch, lol. Are you looking for an amazing shoe? Cushioning, smooth rocker bottom?? These are them, I couldn't be happier. I also introduced them to another friend who worked ICU with me for many years, she bought them and adores them too!!! (yes they are a little on the narrow side, just be aware)\n",
      "I went a full size down and they fit better but these are kinda wide.  Nonetheless I love them!\n",

      "Nice durability, comfortable and stylish.\n",
      "This pair of Sketchers is now the second pair I've bought, where the left shoe does not fit as well as the right.  The left is slightly loose.  I have the first pair of Go Walk Sketchers I bought, and they fit fine, so I have to assume the fault does not lie with my left foot.  Disappointed, given the price.\n",
      "I have flat feet that are large in width so the 1st few times they were a bit snug & uncomfortable to wear. After those few times they are most comfy casual shoes yet ......the material is made from bamboo so didn't help with the comfort the first few times wearing them either :(\n",
      "The boots are lights ,very confortable but the only thing that I did  not liked was are so tall.\n",
      "Not what I expected would not order again\n",
      "This is my second pair but different color. excellente.\n",
      "Slippers are adorable and so soft on the inside!  Love the rubber sole too.  Very comfortable!  My size is 8 and read from some reviewers that it runs a little larger in size, so I did go with size 6.5-7.5 and it fits wonderfully.\n",
      "It is larger than I anticipated.  I have not used it yet but it is brand new and will work great.\n",
      "Returned for a pair of Asics Cumulus. They were just okay, I ordered too big which was my own fault but I really didn't like the look of them all that much anyway once I got them. Not enough arch support for me, personally. Width was good, I have a wide foot. I'm kind of glad I didn't order the right size because I would have probably kept them. I am so much happier with the Asics I bought instead- I feel like I'm walking on a cloud. These shoes felt a little stiff like cardboard.\n",
      "Arch and ankle support are critical in this type of boot. This boots has that.\n",
      "These boots were order as the 9c which is the wide width when we received them the box and the shoes were marked 9b when we went to return these we were told that they were 9c's and were just mismarked well they were too narrow so we are now returning for refund would not suggest these if you are looking for a wide width.\n",
      "I love these shoes! I got them to wear around town because they look cute and comfortable, and they are. I added some insoles to add extra arch support for long walking days. Overall, excellent boots!\n",
      "I have had great luck with Brooks running shoes. They offer great stability and effectively cushion my feet.\n",
      "Very nice\n",
      "Fits as expected, fast delivery, very pleased.\n",
      "Cheep, made in China although they advertised as made in America, and they were a size too big. They are going back.\n",
      "Love them! I ordered a 1/2 size larger than normal.they fit perfect.great gym shoe.\n",
      "I initially bought an 11 and to exchange for a 12.They're fine now. I usually wear an 11 so I  guess they ran a little small. It could be the style of shoe rather than a dress oxford.\n",
      "Merrell are great boots, fit and feel great. I wear them everyday and on concrete floors. This is my third pair!\n",
      "Love these shoes!  Best hiking shoe i've ever had!\n",
      "Love these sandals!  Cushioning and comfortable yet attractive and easy to put on!\n",
      "To be fair they didn't fit me, which doesn't mean that they don't fit. Brooks makes a great shoe with great arch support.\n",
      "They're a lot darker than pictured. If backlit, you can see the tortoiseshell pattern but otherwise they just look a very dark brown. This was a bit disappointing to me but otherwise they're a good pair of sunglasses, they look well-made and they feel sturdy.\n",
      "love my boston's and now I love these. Finally they made a male flip flop.  Great comfort.\n",
      "Happy with the purchase\n",
      "I love it\n",
      "i do love the  sparkle of this bag,,,after all that was one of the reasons for purchasing it.... HOWEVER.... it is MISSING 2 RHINESTONE STUDS in the same area so the missing studs are quite noticeable! The other reason for the purchase is I like LARGE bags,,,while the size of this bag is okay the opening is small... disappointed in that...but oh well  when ordering online it is always a hit or miss!\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "For my wife and she is super excited to have them for her first trip to Disney!\n",

      "I loooooove this product so so much &#60;3.<br />It makes me look cool like superman\n",
      "I love these shoes.  So comfortable!\n",
      "Really love this style of shoe.  More sturdy than a slip on, but less bulky than a true sneaker. I had a pair in yellow that I got all greasy from biking, so I switched over to black.  They're holding up well, comfortable, and seem like they would survive a run through the washing machine if I wanted to clean them up.  Very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Sweet\n",
      "Excellent shoe, great quality great price.\n",
      "I had to add inserts to the back of my heel because the size 6.5 was too small ad the size 7 was too big.  I have narrow heels.  With the inserts (they stick the the inside back of the shoe) they fit great!\n",
      "Terrific shoe at a reasonable price promptly delivered. Thanks!\n",
      "These boots have the typical timberland comfort.  They are not heavy to wear all day.  I do find that I need to lace them up pretty tight to keep my toes from rubbing the composite protective toe on the boot but all in all they seem like a good boot right from the box.  My rule of thumb is to get 1 year for every $100 I spend.  I would guess that in roughly a year the soles will start cracking which is also typical for timberland boots.  But they are work boots and I do beat them up for that year, and quite honestly they are comfortable.\n",
      "My grandson Sam loved them. He couldn't wait to try them on and show them to his cousins!\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Oakley are always excellent quality glasses. The lenses are a nice strong green color that can't be seen through when worn.\n",
      "perfect fit and you can add another sole for extra comfort\n",
      "These shoes are by far the most comfortable wedges I've ever put on my feet. I HATE wearing heals but I love these shoes! I own them in black as well.\n",
      "I ordered this pair for my mother who has swollen feet and she LOVES these shoes!  She said they're comfortable, she likes the fact she can adjust the strap as needed, and they have fantastic support.  She wears these shoes all day long.  She has raved about them so much that I'm ordering a pair for myself!!\n",
      "I have purchased the sneaker before in the stores in white in a size 81/2. My true closed shoe size is 10.  Based on the reviews I decided to order the 9 and they fit perfect! So, measured your feet ladies and go with those measurements.\n",
      "Not as comfortable as they look\n",
      "It's a nice shoe that gives an outfit a pop of color.  Not a shoe to wear for periods of time if you have problem feet.\n",
      "The only complaint I have about these shoes is they do rub on the back of my heel, giving me a blister but they are extremely comfortable.  I would go up 1/2 size from what you normally wear in them too.\n",
      "I love these shoes. They are the most comfortable shoe I have found. The trouble is that I keep having to replace them every few months because  the soles separate from the shoes. Maybe New Balance could find out what kind of glue the other brands use because I am on my forth and final pair unless the quality control improves.\n",
      "My husband had the same shoes in another color.<br />Every day he had to walk 30min to work, and after work.<br />Very comfortable shoes\n",
      "As described\n",
      "I was actually very impressed with this little bag. I purchased mine in Coffee color. Shipping was fast.<br /><br />Every compartment zips which is nice with keeping things in. The main compartment has son padding witch gives the bag done structure and helps protect an iPad. It holds quite a bit but it's not a huge bag, my iPad mini fits nicely in its case with room to spare. The side pockets are great for an iPhone 5 in a fitted case but an iPhone 6 would be to big but the many othe pockets would work nicely.<br />The strap is soft and comfortable. The zippers are smooth and functional. My only complaint is the lining is a little cheap but it does not bunch up and get in the way.<br /><br />I usually carry Fossil or Vera Bradley bags. I got this for something different and small.\n",
      "Nice boots, purchased for short term protection during floods.  They are a little hot for southern weather, but are perfect to wear to get in and out of cars and buildings during heavy rains.\n",
      "These are super cute!  I wish they had been around when I got married!!  I was worried that it would be hard to see where I was going with the lettering and designs in the way, but it was just fine.  I could see without a problem.  I can't wait to give these to my brother and his soon to be wife at their wedding!  I was able to purchase these at a discount in exchange for my honest review.\n",
      "The purse is very pretty, but the clasp is very hard to open.  I was disappointed with this purse because of this.\n",
      "Very comfortable fits like they should got a great deal thanks to Amazon\n",
      "Before I purchase, I read a review which was about its small size. So, I ordered size 7 even though I usually wear 7.5 or 8. However, size 6 was arrived to my home. The funny thing was it fits to me and I am wearing the shoes. Consequently, tt is way smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Besides the size thing, it is comfortable and easy to wear and take off. If you are considering buying this, one thing you need to notice is that the rare part of the shoes is lower than common shoes.<br /><br />I satisfied this purchase but I gave 4 stars because of its small size.\n",
      "Second pairs of this model Gel-Kayano (#21). Fit as expected (they always run 1/2 size small).  I always order a second pair before the model changes - just in case the next one is off (happens every few years). Great support for narrow, flat, overprinting feet. I clock at least 15 miles/week walking and even used them for some light hiking recently (although it was a bit rough on them). I still have second pair in the box.\n",
      "I am a nurse and on concrete all day;  love the cushion;\n",
      "So far; so good. Bought these as a &#34;one pair does everything&#34; traveling shoe. After the first month of ownership and the first week-long trip I'm really satisfied. Shoes hold a shine well, look good with casual outfits, and will pass as dress shoes. Sizing seems to run true. I don't have any special arch support issues so I can't make a judgement on that attribute. The shoes are SUPER light weight, yet seem to be sturdy. The real test will be to see how long they last. (Hopefully this pair will be much better than the Keens they replaced.)\n",
      "I have bought at least a half a dozen pairs of these over the years. I love them. They mold to your feet and give great support. I wear them all year round. This pair, however, seemed to be a bit larger. My toes are sneaking out over the top edge and they are the same size I always get. I have never had that problem before. Makes me think I need to try shoes on rather than ordering online, even if it is the ones I have bought many times.\n",
      "Attractive style although a little wide.\n",
      "Not sized right.\n",
      "I bought these to wear at work (because I worked in a greenhouse, wet feet was an issue) and they were perfect for that because they were made to be wet, had  some traction, and protected my whole foot. When they arrived one of the eyelet guard things was broken, which was annoying but not something I cared to complain over. However, after less than a month of wearing them they began to rip apart at the seams. Sort of disappointing, I was hoping they would last a bit longer. Maybe I was expecting too much, to hope that a $35 pair of shoes would last for more than a month.\n",
      "Veri nice boots<br />Just to go out nothing special<br />Material should be more better.\n",
      "Just what I expected excellent\n",
      "Love them!! Just what I wanted.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "The strap along the big toes causes pain in the toes.\n",
      "From the toe, uncomfortable\n",
      "Love love love love them\n",
      "So freakin' cute!!! Love these & wearing them in Paris next month ❤️\n",
      "I like these, but not as much as the MT610V2s that these were meant to replace. They are great walking and light hiking shoes. They are sub-par running shoes compared to the MT610V2 versions.\n",
      "Loved the shoe but too small and did not come in my size.\n",
      "Great shoes for racquetball according to my husband for whom I ordered these.\n",
      "ASICS makes an excellent shoe for walking, just as they do for running. This one is incredibly comfortable. I'm on my feet all day, and this shoe is a winner.\n",
      "Bought these for my dad and he loves them!\n",
      "Very nice quality. I have large Oakley sunglasses and it fits them perfectly. Micro fiber bag and cloth are a real plus.\n",
      "I LOVE REEF flops!!!\n",
      "Love Reebok classics! Best fitting and most comfortable shoe. I'm on my feet at least 12 hours a day and my feet always feel great.\n",
      "They are legit and the price is great!\n",
      "Shoes are as great as I had expected from amazon.  Good job, thank you jerry\n",
      "Ouch what is going on in the front of these shoes? They pinched my toes badly.  Too bad they were cute but had to return.\n",
      "These shoes are great.  Very comfortable.  I wear a 5.5 and they are the perfect fit.  I am going to buy more in different colors.\n",
      "I like the style of the shoes. There is zero support though. Keds aren't known as an orthotic shoe so this is not unexpected. The ortholite footbed does almost nothing. The sole is thin so you can feel the unevenness of the ground/ pavement when you are out walking. For this reason, I would never recommend these shoes for walking. To run around to stores or anywhere indoors, they are fine as long as you add your own support inserts. I could not wear them for any extended period of time without my own insert.\n",
      "I'm in love with these! I get comments all the time. Perfect product for the price. Also comes with protective case and cleaning wipe so that is a bonus. If these came in additional colors I would for sure purchase more\n",
      "Ordered a size larger and still to small.\n",
      "Most comfortable kitchen shoes I've ever owned.\n",

      "loved it\n",
      "these shoes are are super comfortable!\n",
      "Super!\n",
      "Falling apart after only two times wearing them. Would not buy again.\n",
      "Loved the color and look of the shoes, the width was just fine. But....a few of the reviewers mentioned the shoes were running big.....they're recommendation was to get the shoes 1 size smaller....I did, that's why they were sent back!<br />TOO SMALL!  Doesn't even begin to express how small they were.....!<br /><br /> If anyone else is reading my review, just be aware of their comments, and then, buy the real size of shoes you normally wear.....!\n",
      "Just bought, feel light and very soft but need some time to check durability.\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "The back is too tall and very uncomfortable. I wore them and left my house in the morning and had to return in the afternoon to change them because they had already cut my upper heel. I love this brand but I do not recommend this model.\n",
      "I have 8/12 by 4E which might as well be a square foot or a Hobbits. New balance is the only shoe I can trust to buy online without trying on first.\n",
      "This BackPack is great. Very sturdy. Only thing gripe is the zippers on the front end. Sometimes they get stuck. I hope nothing worse comes of that issue. Either way, great value and i know this will last me at least 2 years or so.\n",
      "Bad this product is ugly , my girlfriend cut me of for this item\n",
      "Have always been a J Renee fan.  Love the shoes\n",
      "Loved how they felt while squatting, very stable and great for allowing me to hit depth. Definitely recommend for people with lack of ankle mobility. My biggest gripe and why it isn't 5 stars is that the shoes are super narrow. I don't have wide feet and these are still tight enough to cause a bit of discomfort towards the end of my lifting session.\n",
      "I'm on my feet all day, and I have tried many different brands of expensive shoes, including Dansko, MBT, Nike air max, Timberland etc. None of those brands are as comfortable as my work Crocs! I love them, and bought several extra pairs  to have as back-ups. They are so comfortable, and they require no break in period. They look good with slacks (business casual) or jeans, and they come in several colors. I have them in three different colors, and use them all regularly. I did have to order a size up, I usually wear a 7 1/2 and had to get the 8, which fits perfectly. The other plus is that they cost a fraction of what I paid for some of these other brands! Love, love, love these shoes!\n",
      "Stretched out the first time I wore them. Could not return, so they were no use to me.\n",
      "I was disappointed in the fit and it is impossible to keep the shoes on my feet when I am walking.  I love Finn shoes- this is my second pair and the styling and quality are very good.  However, with shoes - it is all about fit!  The arch support on these is not nearly as good as my prior pair of Finn.  I love that the straps (both) are adjustable but I still can't keep them on my feet when I am walking.  I really needed a pair of sandals that I could wear to work and make the walk into work comfortably.  These don't work.  I'm basically using them as house shoes to wear around the house.  I apparently need a higher heel or a back strap in order to walk comfortably and keep the shoes on my feet.\n",
      "Comfortable and Stylish but A Little Small. I'd say go one size bigger than your usual shoe.\n",
      "nice light-weight golf shoe - no problem walking 18 holes\n",
      "The main reason I purchased these insoles is to help with my metatarsalagia from running. They are very cushion-y and have allowed me to run with no pain. One drawback is that they are super thick, especially in the arch to heal. I would have preferred to have more cushion for the ball of my foot and less in the arch/heel.<br /><br />That being said, I'm running comfortably again and will be able to complete the half marathon I'm training for, so that's a huge plus!\n",
      "These sneakers provide excellent comfort to my soles! Two thumbs up!\n",
      "Since I got these for $14.99 I have to say I got an incredible bargain and they're very comfortable.\n",
      "Very nice for the price.  As pictured and fast delivery\n",
      "Yeah--I love this bag.  Only gave it a 4--which is somewhat unfair, since these are MY issues and it is described online perfectly:  it's a little (pun unintended) too small.  Also, I like everything about the design EXCEPT a deeper pocket in back would be better & an open pocket in front in addition to the 2 zippered pockets.<br />I had a leather bag exactly as described above.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to find another!\n",
      "super cute, sadly they were not comfortable for me. But I have foot problems and the wedge put just enough pressure on the ball of my foot that I couldn't keep them. They are really nice, I wish I could have kept them.\n",
      "The color was Black instead of Navy. Otherwise everything was as expected.\n",
      "I wish that they were offered in other colors.  I would buy them in all colors offered.\n",
      "I bought these boots about 4 months ago and recently decided to read some of the stuff other people said about them. I want to clear something up that ive read in some comments on the boots. These boots are fairly thick leather and have a long break in period if they hurt your feet thats just how its going to be for a little while the only advice i have to offer people with that problem is bet better insoles and you can ride out the stiffness and then realize these are very well priced. Only complaint is the massive price increase for large sizes i wear a 14 US or aka the 13 UK and paid 150 were someone with like a 9 US paid 80 when I bought them a while back. Notice in the picture all the creases those don't happen overnight so again just ride it out\n",
      "I love them but they were just too small so I gave them to a friend and ordered myself a larger pair.  The faux chinchilla is wonderful.\n",
      "Beatiful shoes!\n",
      "Versatile cross body and will fit more than you think.\n",
      "I lifeguarded throughout the summer and was scared to use my $200 pair of ray bans, I found these on Amazon and they were great for wear and tare purposes. By the end of the three months of wearing them throughout the day they had little scratches but they got the job done. The fact that they are polarized helped a lot. They are very light because they are made out of all plastic but I didn't mind, I knew that by the end of summer I would probably toss them.\n",
      "These are great in an arsenal of basic sneakers. They give a slim profile and are very cozy. The leather/suede upper is a great touch, but does not clean easily. These are a flatfooted shoe, so if you have problems with arch support you should definitely consider alternative footwear for daily out-and-about.<br /><br />Add to this that they are affordable. I wear them regularly Sp/Su/F and get about 2 years of wear which is above par as far as many sneakers go.\n",
      "The shoes fit as expected, and the only reason that I didn't post 5 stars is that they didn't seem to wear very well. What I mean is, after about the thrid time I wore them, on the right shoe, the glue began seperating from the toe. I didn't stub it or anything, and only wore these to the YMCA to excercise, but they just kind of started falling apart. The fifth time I wore them, one of the loops on the heel came off. They were shipped quickly and the packaging was right for the item enclosed.\n",
      "My daughter has 3 pairs.  When I visited her I tried them out and went home and ordered my own.  I love them.  Comfortable, stylish and nothing between the toes!!!\n",
      "I haven't taken these into the water just yet, but wanted to comment on the size for others who are looking. I normally wear a U.S. women's size 7.5 to 8 in shoes. Assuming I would want a snug fit for water shoes I sized down to the 7s in these and they were very loose which would have caused a lot of drag and slipping walking on river beds and such. I received the 6 today and they feel like a perfect fit, snug enough that I am hopeful they'll maintain this comfort when wet. These are shown as women's sizes, but as I wear a 6 in men's athletic shoes, I'd suggest just buying whatever your men's equivalent size would be...<br /><br />I will try to update once I wear these out but so far I'm pleased now that I have found the right fit.\n",
      "Excellent product!  Arrived  on time\n",
      "From my granddaughter's wish list; as far as I know, she loves them and wears them all the time.\n",
      "Very cute shoes, however, they dug into my heels after a couple of hours.\n",
      "These are very cute shoes and are very comfortable for the most part. They run slightly narrow but not too uncomfortably so. The insole is nice and soft and the rest of the shoe is well constructed. The only reason for 4 stars (rather than 5) is that the heel is somewhat abrasive, like many shoes. This is an easy fix with a couple of small band-aids or socks that come up high enough in the back.\n",
      "These are the most comfortable sandals I own and I love the purple/pink color! I usually wear a size 7.5 in nike athletic shoes, since sandals normally run a bit smaller than athletic shoes I ordered a size 7 in women's and they fit perfect. They are slightly wider than thong sandals but they were not too wide and I think the slightly bigger width adds to the comfort. I normally don't like slide sandals because they fall off my feet but these are made of a special rubber and they kind of stick to your foot so they don't fall off easily. The rubber sole on these feel like those anti fatigue kitchen mats, I think they are much more comfortable than the memory foam sandals nike makes. The only reason I rated these 4 instead of 5 stars was the price. I know the purple/pink color is hard to find but these shoes really shouldn't cost over $30 and the ones I bought were $56 so they were overpriced. You can get the black color for $30 at most stores, however I have only been able to find them in mens sizes. For reference I wear a size 7 in womens but when I ordered the black pair I wore a size 6 in mens (even though the chart said I should get a 5). Would I buy these again for $56, probably not, but I really wanted the purple/pink color and they were a splurge. I still love these shoes though and they are exceptionally comfortable, you won't be disapointed!\n",
      "Fit well, great for mowing grass on sunny days.\n",
      "It's a tiny little metal shoe horn. I guess it's cheaper to make these out of metal. I think it's better to get a plastic one, though. There is no reason to make this out of metal. If you're worried about a plastic one snapping then you've got bigger issues.<br /><br />Covered in black paint. The edges seem smooth. Haven't had any problems with jagged edges catching on my socks.\n",
      "Good product... good frame and glass but I didn't like how it looked on me.\n",
      "Well, I have a problem, the item was smaller than expected. I would like to know if there's a way to make a change because they are really small.<br />If you can help me I would really appreciate, my email is japf1492@gmail.com Thank you so much.\n",
      "Shoe as expected\n",
      "Can't find these glasses anywhere anymore.<br /> Love pocket clip\n",
      "Awesome shoe.  I'm getting a lot of compliments on them too.\n",
      "The shoes ran small and the clasp was broken when it arrived. Unfortunately I didn't realize it was broken until I had already worn them. I'm very disappointed.\n",
      "Son asked for these to be ordered to use while in military to train. Shoes held up well and gave good support during ten weeks of training, .\n",
      "I like these shoes and would buy again, but the arch support should be better, hence 4 out of 5\n",
      "Thank you !\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Bought these and once they were delivered put them on immediately.  They are a marvelous pair of Fivefingers! Soft leather gives this pair an understated classic look when compared to normal fivefingers sporty get noticed colors.  I use these for extensive travel. Fit is perfect for average size 12.5 foot size,  quality of materials great, quality of workmanship is there too.  I WISH I DID BUY MORE OF THESE.\n",
      "Very cute, but large on my 14mo. She's in the 50% for height and weight, so average sized baby, but these won't fit her for awhile.\n",
      "The shoes are very comfortable however the sizing, according to my foot doctor, runs a bit small.  She pointed out how close the toes are resting at the very end of the insert.\n",
      "Love these\n",
      "I love these shoes but I got the wrong size\n",
      "These fit as expected and are great for any kiddo with a wide foot!\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Initially they were pretty tight, second time I wore them they seemed to have stretched out, so much so that I am concerned after repeated wearing they would become way to big. Also, after wearing them for over an hour in the house, my feet began to sweat quite a bit. As much as I like them, the style and color and I really like Merrell shoes, I'm afraid I am going to return them because of the sweaty feet and fear of after complete break in I would walk right out of them.\n",
      "There is always the stigma of purchasing shoes online that they will never fit perfectly. Well luckily enough I was able to try these shoes on at the store and get the correct fit that I liked. They came in 3 days above schedule and did what shoes do . Only wish I got them in a different color\n",
      "Nice shoes, comfortable!\n",
      "Beautiful and incredibly comfortable! Wore the for over 16 hours on a very busy day with lots of walking involved and my feet were not hurting at all by the end of the day.\n",
      "super cute! love!\n",
      "The first time I put them on the zipper broke. Until now I couldn't remember where I bought them.  A total loss of my money.  No more Jessica Simpson for me!!  Thank you for nothing  Nancy Ffrench  Yes it is Ffrench with a double f\n",
      "Daughter very pleased with these boots.  Seem well made.  Nice rugged bottoms.\n",
      "High end tri-fold wallet, with bill compartment, coin pouch, many card slots and a window pocket. This stylishly designed wallet is perfect for any one.  This luxury wallet is made of genuine cow leather and the quality is great.\n",
      "These were for my 11 year old 'princess'.  She LOVES anything with sparkles & heels!!  So these were a huge hit with her.  She wears them EVERYWHERE and has had adults wish they could get them in their size!\n",
      "Super cute and comfy. Until they have now failed. With a huge open crack in them where the foot bends. Right shoe now useless. I am so disappointed that I can not return for refund. Vendor should take the hit on these, not me. They did not even last the full season I bought them for.\n",
      "I uv it\n",
      "First of all I order the shoe in black. All identifications (labeling on box) indicated that the box contained the correct shoe. Unfortunately, upon opening the box I found a navy blue/white mixed shoe. Once over my anger, I tried the shoes on, they were very comfortable. I wear them all day and my feet does not burn or hurt. I have ordered another pair, hopefully they will be black as I requested.\n",
      "Love these shoes. They're very comfortable and they are extremely breathable which is important when you're trying to stay cool in the hot summer months.\n",
      "I want to send them back.\n",
      "Size is perfect and Amazon maintain the delivery schedule.\n",
      "I love these shoes! They are exactly as they appear in the picture and are comfortable! I normally wear an 8.5 and ordered that size but they run a tad large. They will be perfect in the fall/winter with thick socks. I was happy with them and was impressed at how fast I received them after placing my order.\n",
      "Easy Spirit is my go-to sneaker. They had discontinued the style I preferred but these are a perfect replacement. I have a heel spur and trouble with foot cramps with most shoes but these are comfortable and do not cause me a bit of problem. Relatively inexpensive for a sneaker but I'll be buying another set soon because they are perfect for me.\n",
      "The shoes fit great and are really comfortable!\n",
      "just great.\n",
      "The sole broke in one shift. And by broke I mean I had a chunk fall off. Service was not very nice about it either\n",
      "June just a smidge small  compared to normal addidas but not enough to go up a size. Loom amazing, even the tread is retro. My new favorite shoe.\n",
      "I love the style of these sunglasses, but they are not, as described above, polarized.  They failed every test of polarization.  But if you don't care about this anti-glare technology -- or don't want it since it makes it difficult to look at electronic screens such as GPS devices and cell phones -- then these might be for you.  Even though they have that retro style, they are modern enough to look chic.  They have floating silicone nose pads for comfort; thin gold-tones wire rims on the bottom of the lenses; and a plastic tortoise shell frame top that extends into the arms as well.  These sit comfortably on my face without sliding down my nose.  Besides the lack of polarization, the only thing I'm not wild about is the style of the bridge -- the gold-tone design looks a little cheap, much more so than the rest of the glasses.  For the current price of $20, these are priced right and are a great choice for the style.  Note:  I received a free sample for review.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\n",
      "It not only hurt my feet, but the &quot;design&quot; on the front of one was more pronounced than on the other.\n",
      "My husband is a size 11.5 but after reading the reviews - it says to order 2 sizes up or they become uncomfortable on the heel part. I ordered 13 and were too big! No problem with return. The sz 12 fit better.\n",
      "These really hurt my feet. Angled so your foot crams into the front. Gave me a blister.\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "very comfortable\n",
      "well, tecnically, my wife loves them. She's a life-long Birkie fan, and these sandals did not disappoint.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE !!!!!\n",
      "Love these shoes, much more comfortable than others I have tried\n",
      "I don't wear anything else!!  They are light weight and a great rose color.. I ski and swim in them with no problems!  The lenses are sooo clear!\n",
      "perfect color for my work uniform, comfy and clean. Might buy more.\n",
      "I love this bag!!!!  Great tote for work and also Alabama roll tide roll!!!\n",
      "These shoes were everything that I have come to expect from a Rockport product.\n",
      "The color is odd- more purple than blue. My son said he could not wear.<br />Sent back and paid $15 for shipping. So much for Prime\n",
      "Gave me sores just below my Achilles tendon.  I hope I can wear them once they heal!!\n",
      "So I have bad heel spurs in both my feet so I cant wear a lot of shoes if they dont offer good arch support. I love Fila shoes and saw these and bought them. Its always a risk for me. I got them and wore them to walk around the mall to try them out. They are actually amazing. The sole and arch support are perfect. It felt like I was walking on air and I had no issue wearing them the entire day. I am very happy with them because I never get to wear the shoes that are comfortable and I love how they look. These are the only exception. Oh did I mention they are affordable?\n",
      "I love them.\n",
      "I've been trying to find a Travelon or Travelon-like bag for a while but have been having a hard time with sizing (not too big and not too small).  This does the trick.  Right now, I have an iPad mini, Vera Bradley wallet and makeup bag, small notebook, iPhone 6s (in a thin case), keys, work ID, flash drive and many other bits and pieces and everything fits nicely. I've read other reviews, on other sites, complaining about the short handle and slightly smaller opening.  I'm a 5', full sized gal and the short handle fits well over my arms.  The cross body strap, fully open, had the bag knocking against my shin. So I know I'm going to be able to wear it, comfortably, with a coat.  I wanted to get away from the &#34;all black bag&#34; habit, so I tried the blue.  It's actually a nice neutral color.  Well made, good size, RFID protection, ample storage and a crazy great price on Amazon.  Works for me!\n",
      "slim than i expected<br />got it on time\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE - a lot brighter then I normally wear but absolutely love these shoes!\n",
      "Used for my corssfit training. Fits well for my 9.5 us and light enough to do box jumps and rope climbs\n",
      "I came home form a week in the boundary waters, portaging over the granite rocks, gravel, in and out of the canoe, up and over hills, climbing small waterfalls, and the shoes were great........came home and bought a second pair.\n",
      "Love it..\n",
      "I was hoping for a nice pair of slippers I could wear around my home. What I got was something so horrifically uncomfortable that I decided that I'd rather go barefoot. After taking one step in them, I put the slippers back in the box and returned them.\n",
      "My daughter loves them!\n",
      "First of all these are NOT $65 sandals. I'm glad I got them on sale for $34 but I still wish I never bought them. I bought them for the arch support, which it has, but there are other things about the sandals that completely negate the whole arch support thing and make them really uncomfortable. The foot bed material feels nice and soft but the entire outer edge of the sandal comes up almost like it's forming a cup so that your toes don't lay flat. Instead they are forced upward in a weird position so that the rest of the foot sloped downward into the cupped part and my foot suctions into it as I walk. It's annoying and weird. The raised edge makes sense on most of the sandal except for the toes. I don't really get it. They should lay flat because it would make the arch support do what it's supposed to do. Also the strap that goes between the toes is very hard and hurts my toes. I expected a little better construction for the original $65 price. I guess $34 seems about right if they were more comfortable. My feet always hurt as it is but these make them feel worse. I really wanted to like them. I never leave reviews but I just had to with these.\n",
      "I love these sandals. I liked them so much I bought a second pair. The heel is just right, the craftsmanship and materials what I expected for the price. They're a little bit wide for my narrow foot but they make up for it in style and quality. Many compliments.\n",
      "I love this shoe...Will be buying another pair in 3 months. Comfortable and Awesome!\n",
      "These are fine. The frames are flexible, which is different but nice. I like that they're polarized. They're cute. They came packaged well and in a bag so the lenses were in perfect condition.<br /><br />I think they run pretty large. I was disappointed in their sizing. They fit me pretty well. And yes, I have a petite face, but I'm still an adult.  These were massive on my 3.5yo.\n",
      "Will not purchase because of the white top stitching--detracts from an otherwise appealing a sandal!\n",
      "then design and durability is great. too cheap for its quality.\n",
      "Majority of my shoes are Cole Haan. These Slip-ons require some softening of the top, back ankle of the shoe. Wearing these with socks looks ridiculous. I did not think about getting cuts on the back of my ankles. The Ivory color is what I have. You may be very disappointed if these get dirty. The material is cloth/linen which is a bit difficult to clean dark marks off a light colored shoe.\n",
      "While these shoes are super cute and I adore the print, they are a bit narrow for my wider feet. I can only really wear them to work (a desk job) but I  do get a TON of compliments on them when I do. So I guess it evens out!\n",
      "Way too big!!\n",
      "These boots are good for my wide feet (I ordered a 6.5 wide) and that is my normal size.  I have problems with bunions but the leather is soft and after a few wearings they conformed to the bunions on my feet.  My arches have fallen so I need a good supportive shoe/boot and these have great arch support!\n",
      "I recommend excellent product . All very good\n",
      "This shoes are just perfect. Casual style Wich I love. Beautiful brown color. Very good quality. Bought them for fall season. So excited! My size is 8,5, i ordered my size, but now thinking that I should order 1 size up.\n",

      "I thought their would be fur throughout the inside of the boot but it ended at the ankle. I was expecting them to be warmer but overall good boot.\n",
      "Don't put anything on the inside pockets. The magnetic clasps don't hold\n",
      "I was really disappointed when these shoes did not fit. I am a size 10...in every shoe I own....and these had my toes crammed up against the front of the shoe. I was going to take them to Disney World and was so disappointed that I could not walk around my living room without discomfort, much less a day at the Park. If you are able to order a half size larger than what you normally wear, that is the way to go, in my opinion. They are adorable in every way and would probably be very supportive and cushioned, if worn in the right size.\n",
      "O love it\n",
      "Would have given another star but the lighter color on the sole isn't my preference. I prefer darker since they get dirty quickly.\n",
      "These are my first Crocs, but they won't be my last.  I usually wear a 9W and these were a 10.  At first, they were too big (ie, long), but soon, the extra room was shifted to account for my wide food.  I know they're supposed to be anti-microbial, so I'm anxious to see if my feet will stink or not (they always used to before I started wearing only leather shoes).  My husband is SUPER picky about shoes' appearance and even HE likes them.  Unfortunately there are 2 holes on the arch of each shoe.  I'm guessing they are for ventilation.  Without them, they would be perfect for walking in the rain, or puddles or mud.  Sure wish I'd had these when I was riding buses to get to work.\n",
      "this are for my nephew, he runs track in high school. he said these fit good and the spikes are the right size. the color is cool. and they come in a lot of colors. he would buy more.\n",
      "I've used these in the gym, for hiking, and for everyday use.<br /><br />They're built to last and are rather comfortable. Highly recommend for anyone looking for an all around shoe.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Had to Return, unable to wear, they run wide. Not for a narrow foot.\n",
      "i love it, its so cute, gives you an Indian feel\n",
      "Brother loved it\n",
      "Very suitable\n",
      "Attractive black bag. Nice size when a wristlet is too small. I would feel comfortable gifting this.\n",
      "Love these!  so cute, I have gotten so many compliments on them...good quality, great purchase!\n",
      "My son played in one football game with these shoes and they began to fall apart.  The soles/cleats started separating from the shoe in the heel area during the first game.  The trainers had to tape the soles/cleats to help prevent additional separation and injury prior to the second game.  If cleats separate during play it could lead to a serious injury.  Stay away from these shoes.\n",
      "Too large. Does not cut down to a 7W or fit in my Propet shoe like it said it would.<br /><br />They don't cut down well on the sides, so they don't fit width-wise in my sneakers. They're also too thick for my Propet Mary-Janes, so in the end they were not what I wanted. I realized that the insoles I need are not very typical, but I was hoping these would work....<br /><br />It was a couple hours before it gave me blisters on the top of my foot. It was too tall, so my foot rubbed bad against the top of my shoe.<br /><br />When I finally got it in my shoe, the arch was in the wrong place. So maybe it would have given me good arch support if they were in the right place?\n",
      "These flip-flops are extremely comfortable and look cute with shorts, skirts, dresses, or jeans.\n",
      "The fit was very good and comfortable.\n",
      "They came fast and the quality was great, however they did not come with the ankle buckles, and i was very upset.\n",
      "I am going to note that these are my daughters so I cant give a good review.\n",
      "Really like the shoes good quality.  Have added insole for example training comfort and added growth.inside of shoe lined well no sharp seams.very soft soles.\n",
      "fits perfectly\n",
      "It is very nice but the size was a little bit big.\n",
      "So so\n",
      "Ok I love the shoes but I can only look at it because it can't fit. What is my normal size that I purchase for other shoes seem not to be the standard size as expected that really disappointing since I was waiting enjoy this product which is now a waste. Really disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I like the look of it. I'm 5'1&#34; and it comes down to my knees. I tried to put a knot, but then it was to small to go over my head and shoulder.\n",
      "It's very beautiful and has enough space to put everything in.\n",
      "Excelente...\n",
      "If you are looking for comfort shoes, these are the ones. Pretty, cozy, and comfort are what I can say about these clogs. I like the pattern of the upper which is a combination of two different textures in two different red tones, very subtle, yet pretty. They would be a great to wear in autumn and winter! You would feel warmed up instantly! I don't normally wear clogs because I thought they were for generations of my mom and beyond, but I started to change my mind after trying these on =) My feet feel phenomenal in them. The insoles are super cushioned. So is the lining of the shoes.<br /><br />For the fit, they run mall (as in narrow and short) for wide feet. I got a pair in 8M/W (width: 3-3/8&#34; to 3.5&#34;, length: 9.5&#34;; I didn't exactly understand what that sizing system meant when it had both M and W in it!); and they fit my wide feet very perfectly. I have wide feet but slender heels; and I usually wear 7.5M in closed-toe shoes and 8M-9M in boots (depending on the brands and designs). The long-vamp design covers most of the upper part of my feet, which makes it a little challenging to put them on. However, my feet do not slip out of these shoes while walking. As a result, I'd suggested that if you have wide feet, definitely go at least 1 size up. If you have narrow feet, I would recommend you go with your true clog size.\n",
      "Somewhat narrow.\n",
      "These are her favorite boots by far and they are super cute. I did notice some scuffing on the toes after about three days but in all fairness she was playing on blacktop at school.  These boots would definitely be best for dress and not play. But try telling that to a seven-year-old with a boot addiction!\n",
      "My wife has shoe fitting problems and it is not the boot. The use is for costuming and it works well for the time she wears them.\n",
      "Slippers fell apart in a few days and stretched out so bad my feet were slipping.  The company refunded with no problems.\n",
      "I have worn Ariat paddock boots for a long time. This Ariat hiking boot is so much more comfortable, the sole support is really good. Great for all day walking.\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "Smaller than my actual size\n",
      "Good\n",
      "I'm fall in love on it! Soft leather shoes. Very comfortable, even if you have to walk all day.\n",
      "They re good flip-flops. Pretty durable too. My last pair lasted me about 5 years.\n",
      "great shoe! many compliments! fit as expected!!! I love them!!\n",
      "These are my son's favorite shoes, we try to get Fallen every time.\n",
      "the color is not what it look in the picture, to pale,\n",
      "Excellent!\n",
      "Exceptional shoes in comfort and style.\n",
      "I've had this shoe before and they fit great.\n",
      "I love this case\n",
      "I could stand and walk for days in these shoes. Great for brisk waking, work, dancing... You name it!  I have bad bunion pain and very low insteps and these easily accommodate custom orthotics too. I order a size down and they always fit.\n",
      "Delivery was quick and there were absolutely now problems !\n",
      "I wear between a 7 and a 7.5 but usually but go smaller on heels and larger on boots. These are a little snug, but I don't mind that as I don't like it when they are too big and keep slipping off my heels. The color and shoes are really pretty and will wear well to church and work. Glad I purchased.\n",
      "GREAT, SNUGGLY FIT, THANKS SO MUCH !!!!\n",
      "very good shoes. the color is more blue than gray\n",
      "Perfect ~\n",
      "Very bright red. Lot's of compliments.\n",
      "1st Glance: Packaging & instructions were great and provided value. Easy to follow along and replace lenses and even came with a new pouch for my shades.  One strange thing I noticed and maybe it was just me. When walking with the sun in my face I started to get a slight headache or a dull pain behind my eyes.  I'm not sure if the sun was too bright for this specific polarization but it reminded me of wearing an incorrect prescription of glasses.  Once sitting and reading at the pool, I no longer noticed this issue.<br /><br />4 Weeks In: Starting to notice some a whole bunch of tiny spec marks out of the front of the lenses. I am not noticing a loss in the quality of my vision but from up close they do not look like they did when I purchase these. I clean these with a cleaning kit from Sun Glass hut (where I purchased my other Oakley's).  I haven't seen this isse with my other sunglasses which i've had for a few months longer.\n",
      "Love these shoes\n",
      "I wear size 15 in other shoes, including NB, but the NB 15s and even 16s were too small.\n",
      "Just okay.  Worth the money if you only golf once and a while.  Not waterproof, but they are good shoes for an amateur golfer.\n",
      "Always like these shoes!!\n",
      "Great shoe at a great price!\n",
      "These are great for my work shoes. I wear an 11 and the XL fit perfectly. The smell of the wood is amazing and leaves my shoes fresh and in great shape. Thanks.\n",
      "SInce they discontinued my favorite Ultra Sendor this is next best thing.\n",
      "Great price for these.\n",
      "These shoes feel really good in my feet. The only thing is that while I was breaking them, it seems like they stretched a lot. Before they stretched they were almost perfect. I bought a size smaller of these shoes from a different company & they were way too small. These shoes are great. They just don't quite fit like my Dansko's do.\n",
      "Love this style. Fit great and are very comfortable.\n",
      "Almost three sizes too small!\n",
      "These running shoes are terrific and I am very pleased with the support. Asides is a good brand.\n",
      "Love the shoe!  Have worn it for years. Very durable and comfortable!  Wouldn't wear anything else to play pickleball!\n",
      "Awesome shoes... My favorite Cole Haan´s!! You will never regret to buy them!!\n",
      "Great looking shoes and they fit well.  My only remorse it that the buckles are a pain in the back-side to get on and off.\n",
      "The shoe is beautiful but I ordered a size 7M and a size 10 was delivered instead.\n",
      "The shoes were cute and stylish, but the tops were too tight/narrow.  I couldn't squeeze my average-width feet into them, nor would the material stretch very easily, so I had to return them.\n",
      "VERY CUTE AND GREAT QUALITY\n",
      "Small\n",
      "Cute! Fits just slightly smaller than the other three pairs in the same size off Amazon. All the pairs were the same size and fit as expected but these fit just slightly smaller and my foot hits close to the back edge. With that said, cute cute cute! They also seem to be nice quality.. It will be interesting to see if the Rhinestones fall out of the bottom rim over time with use or collect dirt in between. I guess time will tell, for now I am happy!\n",
      "Great purchase fast delivery time.. Very satisfied with my purchase\n",
      "I have Morgan-nueroma in my left foot and had to give up shallow water aerobics because of the pain. I tried wearing a regular pair of sneakers in the pool but they were completely in appropriate for that use as they soaked up the water like a sponge. I also tried a regular pair of water shoes but there was no support. These Merrell Men's Water shoes however are working out great and now I am able to go back to the classes that I'm able to do with my bad back.I thought they were a little pricey but in the end well worth it.\n",
      "Nice fit.\n",
      "My daughter loves them.  They look really cute with her leggings and seem to keep her little feet warm in the winter.\n",
      "I am giving these boots a 4 even though I am sending  them back. The quality is great and it really is a beautiful boot which is why I am rating it as I am. However,  I have short (5'2&#34;) and muscular legs (14&#34;) but these boots are too wide for my legs. They look like rain galoshes which is not at all cute. I am between a 7.5 and 7 shoe size and ordered the 7 and felt the boots were too long on my foot as well. Sending these back...perhaps I'll try the non-wide calf version in a 6.5? The boot hunt continues.\n",
      "The bag looks as pictured, but you have to put the strap in the front yourself. A bit annoying.\n",
      "This is a going to the store shoe. It didn't last 2 months at work before the sole started falling off. Thank goodness they were on sale.\n",
      "This is the third pair of Keen shoes that I have purchased and they are great. I was a little apprehensive about buying them online but after reading the reviews and considering the input from multiple reviewers I went ahead and ordered the shoes. I did order them a half size larger than I normally wear and they fit perfectly.\n",
      "These are super cute flats, I love the pewter color!  They don't have much for arch support, but they are flats after all and I didn't expect much to begin with.. However for the price and the look, I will still be happy!\n",
      "This boot is great holds up against chemicalss and it is the most waterproof work boot I have tried, and fits so very comfortable. Glad I finally found this boot\n",
      "thank you\n",
      "While I liked the previous model better, this seems to be a suitable replacement, but not an upgrade or improvement....Why do shoe companies keep changing the models? Sometimes the one you have is great and doesn't need to be tweaked.\n",
      "I got these for my husband and he loves them.  They are amazingly comfortable.\n",
      "Wore these to WLC without having broken them in but that wasn't a problem.  I did get a few blisters but they seemed minimal compared to what I've experienced from GI boots besides my feet weren't at all conditioned and I expected a few foot issues from long road marches.  These babies are light and were a dream doing land nav.  For those who like to do an airborne shuffle or slow jog when doing land nav or when rucking, these are on point.  I usually wear a 7 1/2 but sized up to an 8 based on other reviews and they fit perfectly.\n",
      "There really isn't a lot of support for running. Even for long walks I had to put an insert in for more support. Pro's- they're super light, awesome grip and no need to break them in much. Also they're really cute!\n",
      "I wear these only for aerobics classes. I replaced the insole with an orthotic since it didn't have the arch support I need for a Morton's neuroma. Toe space is a bit cramped. I went a half size larger than my usual Skechers but for exercising, I could have used another half size up. A good but not great shoe compared to other Skechers I have owned.\n",
      "I have to say, the reason I bought these was because I am a huge Duchess of Cambridge fan and she has these.  Having said that, if I didn't like them, I would have returned them....but I love them!  They fold up small and have a little case that can fit in a small purse.  They aren't polarized, but they block out the sun pretty good.\n",
      "Was pleasantly surprised as to how comfortable these are!  Great value for the price.\n",
      "I'm usually an 8-1/2 in American brands but in this shoe I would have to be a 9-1/2 which is the size I buy in European brands.<br />Overall I like the look and feel of the shoe but it's hard to comment since the size is so off.\n",
      "I had to return these as I'd ordered an 8 C and they were definitely not a wide shoe, nor properly fitting lengthwise.  Pretty disappointing.  The uppers were a little cheap looking, which I could let go for a less than $40 shoe, but the soles were cheap and slippery with no traction.  I had them on my feet for about 45 seconds before I sighed and put them back in the box.\n",
      "Great shoe.  I normally wear 8.5 - 9 shoes.  I wish I had gone for size 9 but the 8.5 fits fine as well.  As mentioned in another review, go for the larger of the sizes if you're between sizes.  I use these shoes for mountain biking and the grip is amazing!\n",
      "I purchased this shoe to replace an old Naturalizer slip on that i loved but had finally worn out. I ordered the same size (wide) as my old shoe, but this Naturalizer shoe was both shorter and narrower and too tight for me. I was also surprised at the lack of arch support in this shoe. It seemed like it would be a comfortable shoe for someone with smaller feet and who doesn't need much arch support.\n",
      "Within one wearing, the shoes molded to my feet and felt great.  By the second time, I could walk for hours.\n",
      "This is my second pair of these. Enough said!\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Very pleased and will purchase in other colors.\n",
      "The shoes are super cute but unfortunately, they are almost 2 sizes too big and way too wide. Had to return them and get different ones.\n",
      "Very good shoe at a bargain price.  I really enjoyed the quick delivery.  Quality of the shoe is as expected - very good ankle support, comfortable and light - excellent for tennis.\n",
      "I love these... Planning to order another pair!!\n",
      "Excellent. I received more than expected for the price.  In addition to the sunglasses themselves, they came in a hard case with a folded soft case as an option and a few other extra accessories.\n",
      "I love this style of Keen so much that I bought a black pair in addition to the brown pair I have. Comfortable and functional yet stylish. I get many compliments on them. Since they are closed toe, I can wear them on the job\n",
      "Great for by the ocean. My son loves them!\n",
      "Do yourself a favor and add these boots to your cart!!! You know you want to!!! I had always been a true size 7 in my adult life but since becoming pregnant, toting my son around for 9 months and now an additional 3 since he's been born, my feet have gotten super wide and none of my shoes seem to fit so I've sized up to 7.5/8. I thought to order a 7.5 in these but based on reviews stuck with the 7 (since they seem to run large) and crossed my fingers that they'd fit. Well they arrived this am and I am ecstatic!!! These are gorgeous and so supple and have room for even my thickest socks on these wide momma feet! The unlined leather does grip but with boots this gorgeous take a second to appreciate putting them on! I already can wait to order more from bed stu! I ordered the &#34;black lux&#34; and the color is exquisite! A brown boot overall with a lovely black wash. The photo does NOT do them justice and they were the cheapest color option! Score! I LOVE AMAZON!!!\n",
      "Im not one to generally write comments, or reviews but this piece deserves it. I am a Mom of two and I am constantly running around and carrying a million things. This piece is small, looks great and holds everything!\n",
      "I wear a 9.5 but could only find these in a 9. They fit fine. I really like these shoes. They are lightweight and very comfortable. I am used to heavier Keen shoes and am curious how these will hold up. I replaced the insoles but I do that for all of my shoes.\n",
      "Comfortable, light weight, good hiking shoe. Arrived in good condition and as promised. I'm happy\n",
      "Nice shoes. Very light, though. Good for the price.\n",
      "Very comfortable shoe. Loved the color, fit and wearability.\n",
      "I ordered silver and I rec'd pink fitflops. They do not fit the same as other size 7s I have ordered in the past!\n",
      "Love the roxy slip ons! Couldn't be happier with how they look. They tend to be a little wide for my feet, work better in the fall and winter with socks. Also not much for support, but perfect for me to wear to work/school when I'm wanting to wear something other than sneakers. Definitely not something I'd like to wear when I'm on my feet all day though.\n",
      "Let me start off by saying that I am a complete novice when it comes to buying shoes based solely for running. I found a recommendation online and made my decision based on that. I'm very pleased with my purchase and I will most likely continue to buy going forward.\n",
      "My husband loves these shoes! He lives in them! He will never buy another boot ever again!\n",
      "I have wide feet. These are not gonna work for me.\n",
      "For a medium width they are way to wide.  They would provide arch support is foot did not move around so loosely in the shoe.\n",
      "Perfect fit. The arrive date of my package wasn't until sept 11-25 and I received them faster than that. Very pleased with them.\n",
      "This was not my first pair of ASICS shoes.  I keep buying them because they are super comfortable and always fit.\n",
      "My son loves them. They were a bit tight for the first few days but a bit of breaking them in and they are good to go\n"

The sandals are leather, well made and comfortable, really couldn't ask for more.\n",

I personally ordered them a little big, so he could wear them a little bit longer. Fast delivery. Product as described. Very cute! He seems to enjoy wearing these.\n",

Also, on the shoe box it says this product can not be sold in California because it says the chemicals in the material may cause cancer. Ive worn them too much to return and threw away the box.\n",
      "I waited for these shoes for almost 3 weeks. I was disappointed to see they looked almost nothing like the ones in the picture. The heel isn't 3-4 inches like it says, more like barely 2 inches. The strap is halfway broken. The buckle doesn't fit because the strap was made very horribly. I gave it 2 stars because they got to me before the time I was told. Besides that? Very disappointed.\n",

The easiest conversion can be found directly on the Vibram website.<br /><br />That said, these came in properly sized.

      "Side of shoe coming apart after 1 month. First time purchasing hush puppies. I would not buy again. I tried to return to company and they would by replace item. Poor customer service. I would not recommend product.\n",
      "Terrific!\n",
      "Really nice shoes really good price but they are a little too big\n",
      "Cute as a fashion accessory.\n",
      "Needs buy covr for back n front so wont rub skin off.but once thats done.i loved it more\n",
      "The shoes were very comfortable in all other regards, except for being slightly too short, enough to be uncomfortable after a while. I was using thick woolen socks and a I just changed these to normal socks and they fit just fine. Aside from that, everything was good. In the future I would probably have gotten a half a size bigger.\n",
      "But it wear nice.\n",
      "Love these! Hunted all over for them!\n",
      "It creates hot spots on your foot. It's not very confortable. It needs a break in period I guess but it feel bad on the foot. I like that it's light and fits well(size was just right). The lining on the inside is very lumpy so it creates pressure points or hot spots on top of your foot. I had more confortable wolverines in the passed but this one is not up to par  to what I expected. Only time will tell if it will get more confortable.\n",
      "Returned for a larger size.  Run small.  Other than that, they were amazingly comfy for being on my feet for 10+ hours.  They are ugly as sin though, be prepared for some stares.\n",
      "Great s**t\n",
      "Great shoes\n",
      "very nice bag.\n",
      "Pretty cute. Held up with international traveling over 15 days and 8 plane trips as checked luggage. Still looks new.\n",
      "These are awesome, they look cool, make me run fast through the halls, and fix my pronation. Overall awesome. Plus they come in 13s\n",
      "They will be perfect once they are stretched out.  The insides are very comfy!\n",
      "Didn't last very long. My 11 year old wore the seams out within a few months..\n",
      "Same model that I wore out over several years playing golf, so even my 6.5 éee feet will be snug for a while, the shoes will expand enough to be just right within a month or two. Ps:  not expanding. I think they may have been marked wrong. I actually bought a pair from the manufacture as we'll and experiencing same condition. My 9 inch foot compares to a size 6 on international chart but I may need to move up to an 8 to get a comfortable fit.  I need to visit a store that has small sizes.\n",
      "Love these sandles and hope they never never change this style or discontinue them. Very sexy looking on the foot. I have several in different colors\n",
      "I haven't worn them enough to really know. I still need to get used to how high these platforms are. They are kind of hard to walk in but with enough practice it will become easy. They look amazing and they are very good quality. I like them a lot.\n",
      "Beautiful color and style.  I gave them to my daughter.  She loves thems.\n",
      "Just as expected\n",
      "I owned a pair of these shoes before and they quickly  became my favorite pair of work shoes,they lasted me well over a year. They were so nice I decided to buy 2 pair this time! Well after only 3 months they are starting to fall apart especially around the tip of the toe and the inside heal  area. Not sure why they are so different from the last pair, but once this second pair wears out in a few months I will not be buying another pair.\n",
      "Item as described, fit perfect, fast shipping\n",
      "very light and comfortable,good shoes. just run as you wish..\n",
      "So far...the best work shoes I have ever owned, and until  someone suggested I try this shoe,I have only used the brand I trusted most.<br />To say these are better than Red Wing Worx, is a compliment. As an added bonus ...these are half the price.\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Size were too small and they were no quality\n",
      "Nice looking shoe.  Comfortable\n",
      "I have been looking for a good wide toe box shoe for years.  My toes naturally spread out to the point where my wife says I could fit another toe in between the ones I have.  I had researched different ways to lace up shoes to make them feel wider and it worked for a while until my foot would begin to blow out the sides of the shoes.  now insert the Altra One2.  This is the most comfortable running shoe I have ever worn!!!  I have had Asics, Nike, Addidas, Zoot, etc.  This one takes the win easily.  I was previously trading off running in Nike Free 3.0 and the Zoot Ultra Kiawe Race.  I was getting ready to start a marathon training plan for this season and decided I needed a new pair of shoes.  I bought these based on all the other reviews stating how wide the toe box is and the fact they are zero drop!  First pair i bought was a size 10 as that is what I wore in the Nike Free and Zoot Kiawe Race.  The Altras were a little too small, returned for a 10.5.  PERFECT FIT!  I have done multiple long runs in these shoes including speed and tempo work.  Average weekly miles in these shoes is about 30 miles.  They have been great so far!  I will definitely buy another pair of Altras when these give out.\n",
      "they didn't fit well. Love the shoes.\n",
      "These are thin and comfortable in my dress shoes! Helping with my plantar fasciitis.\n",
      "These shoes were larger than I expected and I should have listened to other buyers.  I reordered a smaller size and they now fit pretty good and look great.  Overall i'm pleased with the comfort and looks.\n",
      "comfortable\n",
      "Nice sneakers, my son loves them!\n",
      "These shoes feel great on my flat feet.  I have a wide forefoot and narrow heel and this shoe works for that too.  I have had sciatic problems and an injured left knee, and I can wear this shoe all day long with comfort.  I spent 3 days walking for hours at a golf tournament and felt I could not have done it without these shoes.  It is the most expensive shoe I have ever bought and it was worth every penny to me.\n",
      "These are some of the best shoes I have ever purchased. My close friends all said I was crazy when I told them how much I spent on my new, New Balance shoes, but I am confident with my purchase.<br /><br />I work as a photographer, taking photos all day long for hours on end. Even after spending one of my longest working days (13 hours) on my feet, they did not hurt. I was not in any discomfort whatsoever, and am sure that it was because of how great these shoes are.<br /><br />They may be a bit pricey, considering New Balance doesn't sell anything more expensive, but they are so worth it. If you are looking for a pair of well-made, high-quality shoes, then these are for you.\n",
      "Nice looking shoes! Chosen for a trip.\n",
      "i sent them back. they were too small for my kid, and though the quality is decent there is no excuse for charging $60 for these silly things. they are flimsy slippers.\n",
      "Probably should have gotten a half size smaller, but still a good shoe.\n",
      "I wanted a slipper for around the house that wasn't a thong, didn't cover my whole foot, and wasn't fluffy, and these fit the bill. I love these slippers. They're the same kind my grandma used to wear around the house all day. The mesh is great because it lets your feet breathe, which is awesome for those hot summer days. It's lightweight, and the sole is a very dense foam, so it provides some cushion while not feeling flimsy. They also stay on your feet surprisingly well for a slip-on.\n",
      "Love, loVE, LOVE them! Perfect with tights, skinny jeans, dresses... You name it, they go with it!\n",
      "So much comfort!  I have a wide foot and have been searching for cute wedges for an upcoming vacation.  This is my first pair of UGG's, but they are as comfortable as I would have expected from the brand.\n",
      "hiked 20 miles aound Mount Rainer on first wear.. no problems\n",
      "Fast Delivery of the shoes.  I love the Saucony brand the comfort and fit of the shoe are get whether you are<br />wearing them for daily wear or for running or jogging.\n",
      "Can be dressey or casual\n",
      "I have had so many compliments on these sandals! I love them! No, they don't provide much arch support, but I typically do not expect that from a flat sandal. They are quite comfy to wear all day. I am a teacher and have worn them to work, I must say I am impressed!\n",
      "These Crocs might be fine but they said child/toddler even on the tag, and they are almost big enough to fit my wife.  Probably not a huge deal to return them in the US, but we are overseas so it is a pretty big pain.\n",
      "Love the shoes!\n",
      "I love this purse! It is well made and sturdy. It has a lot of space and pockets. The only thing I would change is to have the handles just an inch longer so it can go on your shoulder better or have the extra strap shorter.\n",
      "They fit perfectly (size 1)\n",
      "Not for wide feet\n",
      "The leather is very nice and the interior is as well.  The main zipper looked to be messed up but once I unzipped and rezipped it seems fine; I'm hoping it holds up as the purse is used.  However, the shoulder strap was a big disappointment.  The wrist strap is beautiful like the clutch itself, but the shoulder strap is a tiny strip of that leather on a stiff, bulky black canvas or something, totally too casual a look for dressier look.  (I definitely don't plan to use the shoulder strap and it was the one I really wanted for that.)  If you're looking for a nice clutch or wrist bag, this is very pretty.\n",
      "excellent shoe\n",
      "My husband loves his new boots!\n",
      "Love these heel boots they are so sexy on and easy to put on<br />they are true to size<br />great for thick legs\n",
      "Not good qvolity\n",
      "The shoe fits really good it my first time ever buying a pair of Nike flyknit\n",
      "The on;y problem...they make my feet sweat.\n",
      "Great for shoes, leather, saddles,\n",
      "This clutch is elegant and look way better than the picture shows. The only complain is that some of the stones are coming out. Would be nice to include some extra stones for replacement.\n",
      "Returned too small\n",
      "fit small and they look very small\n",
      "Good looking shoe and extra padding/foam bottom for a heavy runner.\n",
      "Super cute shoes, but they were too small.  The next size up wasn't available but I kept checking back.  When they were avail, the price increase made me mad. So I didn't end up getting them. :-(\n",
      "These boots are beautiful and fit perfectly. I bought the size I normally wear in a boot and they are just right. The laces do actually adjust and there is a leather tongue behind them so you can open the front up if you need more room for your calf and there isn't a bunch of skin or stocking showing.\n",
      "I now have these in both black and silver and they're just fab!  Great looking and comfortable enough to wear all day long!\n",
      "These are really pretty shoes, I ordered them in white and they look really nice, but the toe box was a little too pointy and made my size 11 foot look even longer:(. I still highly recommend them because the are attractive pumps!\n",
      "You can't beat these shoes for the price!\n",
      "Nice!\n",
      "By far best running shoe for those on the husky side. It's has amazing arch support and does not wear down as fast as other shoes. I run about 15 miles a week. Amazing shoes!\n",
      "I have owned a pair before and really enjoy them over other flip flops!\n",
      "Absolutely adorable with lots of cool blinking lights!  Unfortunately  these run smaller than other Geox shoes of the same size.  Hopefully I can exchange for a larger pair.  They arrived on time and well packaged for shipping.\n",
      "Absolutely beautiful, very well made. Like art for my feet. I love them.\n",
      "These shoes are stylish and comfortable.\n",
      "nice boots little narrow for wide\n",
      "Very nice boots it fits on me :-D...\n",
      "Third pair for me, just love,love,love them.\n",
      "Ive hax great experiences with this boot.  I wear them as a combination of daily shoe,  work boot,  and motorcycle boot.  They are comfortable like sneakers and offer the protection i was looking for as a summer/short ride motorcycle boot.  They have lasted for a little over 2 years where i used to go through otger boots in 1 year.  At the end of their life the leather,  stitching, and tread all wore out at the same time.  Maybe a downside for some but i dont care is the black color fades to green as they age (see pic of 2.5 ywar old boot) I went through 2 pair of laces.  I wish this boot was one of their made in the USA boots.  I would be willing to pay more if it was.\n",
      "I have had issues with my feet for years. I've spent thousands of dollars on shoes the past 5 years. I was worried about buying shoes at all online, but the price was great and they looked exactly like what I was looking for. I was familiar with the brand and their quality, so that eased my mind a bit. I've tried Clark's and they had no cushion or support. Same with all the other brands, high end or not. These boots are great! They are very comfortable and cushioned. They look really nice. I've gotten a bunch of compliments every time I wear them.\n",
      "I've been getting this shoes since iteration 13. They have always been great, and this iteration are a lot lighter than 16 that I had before.\n",
      "Nice polarized, lightweight, good quality sunglasses!  Can't beat that for $13!\n",
      "Great shoes but felt narrow!\n",
      "I normally wear a size 9.5 so I ordered a 10. It is really tight and I can't wear it comfortably at all.\n",
      "The quality meets my expectations for the price. Love the one for one philosophy of Toms, it's made me a lifetime customer!\n",
      "Love them! Just what I was looking for...thanks\n",
      "I LOVE the hoka One Women's Cliftons.  I tried on the Clifton 2s and there is no comparison in width and comfort.  I will have to buy another pair on line before they disappear since Hoka is not replicating this great shoe!!!\n",
      "I love it!  Amazing! I want all the colors.\n",
      "Very pleased!\n",
      "A bit on the short side for an 8.5 but since only for a costume they'll do. I would order at least a half size up though.\n",
      "Order them a size larger than you think you should so they fit.\n",
      "The bend lines cut into my foot, so I can't give it a 5 star.\n",
      "I bought a size 7 because I heard these run large.  ( I am a 7 1/2). The 7 was still big.  But it did allow me to put in arch supports so now it is very comfy\n",
      "Stylish and functional!\n",
      "It is so hard for me to find boots because of my calfs. These boots are amazing, comfy, and most importantly fit my big calfs!! I highly recommend them, especially if you have the same problem as I do!\n",
      "Love these... Ton of compliments! Comfortable!\n",
      "Beautiful shoe. Fits very well. The unique clasp took me a second to figure it out. And the silver material of the actual shoe was slightly peeling in one small spot. But I'm not fussing. It's an all around beautiful, comfortable shoe that I can't wait to wear.\n",
      "I own several pairs of Skechers sandals and I am giving three stars for two reasons:<br />1. they run a bit large and loose;<br />2. The straps are hard and not that comfortable as those made from fabric martials.<br /><br />I got them at a good price and I am keeping them. I wish they make more of those with fabric material on the straps which stretch and offer more comfort and flexibility.\n",
      "They fit let kid sunglasses. The lens where not very clear and scratched easy. Not very comfortable to me at all. I have long eye lashes and they rubbed.\n",
      "Nice and comfort\n",
      "I have had the classic Blundstones for 15 years and this year I decided to get fancy. I'm really glad I read the other reviews in advance about the sizing: these boots really do have LONG toes because of the shape. Every review recommended that I order a size down.  I did and they fit PERFECTLY.  (My other blunnies are a size 8 US Women's, and I ordered a size 7 USW for this style.)<br /><br />Also, they are wonderful boots but do take time to break in.  For example, if you were to use these for horseback riding and you decide to wear them for the very first time cow sorting for 2 hours you will be sorry.  Start slow.\n",
      "Greatfit\n",
      "First pair of two ATTCL glasses I bought (second pair was their wayfarer).<br /><br />Same love for both, same criticism for both.<br /><br />Awesome high quality glasses but the nose stands are too small for the weight, not a big issue unless you wear them for hours straight.<br /><br />Got lots of compliments on both pairs.\n",
      "I love the look of the snearkers, but they are not very comfortable.  I wore them for spin class, and my feet hurt.  However, they are comfy for walking.  Saucony is an excellent brand of running shoes.  I swear by them; however, this model is not made for exercising.\n",
      "Very beautiful.\n",
      "Great for the price. Exactly what I expected. Nicely packaged.\n",
      "need to re-order\n",
      "These are bright shoes, and definitely true to the picture! They are comfortable, but definitely make sure that you size up at least a half size. They are extremely well made and cute shoes. These will be a fun addition to my summer outfits.\n",
      "Great Buy!\n",
      "I should have listened to the other reviews.  I could not get my foot into the boot.  Shame...because these are well made, lovely boots!\n",
      "I really liked these shoes alas, so did my dogs. Goodnight Sweet hush puppies. You will be missed.\n",
      "Great fit very comfortable\n",
      "These are so cute! They fit snuggly, so if you have to wear socks - wear thin ones or stockings. Also it wouldn't hurt to scotch guard them, as the material can easily get dirty from everyday wear. Overall I love them.\n",
      "I don't feel that I'm wearing a shoes , light and comfortable.\n",
      "Nice looking shoe that fits well. Extremely comfortable.\n",
      "Pretty much liked the shoes, but they hurt across the base of my big toe. For this reason, I returned them. They also had a weird tongue set up if you laced the last hole- didn't come up to the top of the laces. My first pair of fitness shoes...maybe they're all like that. They are not made for cushion and support, IMHO.\n",
      "the boots were way to tight.  I ordered the size I would wear in Red-Wings or Carolina's and these seemed to be extremely narrow boots.\n",
      "Loved it as soon as I saw it and immediately got disappointed when I tried it on )-: like someone else posted, bout a half size too small. so bummed, wish they had it in half sizes or a 12. considered returning and ordering a 9 in men's, but its just not the same since this is a wedge and the men's is just a regular straight flipflop.\n",
      "My dog ate my first pair of wedges, they were my favorite pair as well. I could not find them at other shoes stores, checked here and I found them. I wear these wedges to everything, work, church, parties, and everything in between. They are comfortable and easy for me to walk in. Thank you amazon for having them.\n",
      "It's too narrow for my girl\n",
      "These are really good for the price. They are comfortable and warm. I have bigger calves and these fit me good. I liked them enough to go back and buy them in black!\n",
      "I have very narrow feet so these were just fine for me. The heel is perfect for walking long hours\n",
      "Great fit and great shoe!\n",
      "Somewhat tight in the heel, but otherwise very comfortable.\n",
      "I like these boots, didn't fit too big like many other people said.. I'm usually a 7 1/2 and that's what I ordered, and they fit with socks which is what I like.  I think the heel might be a little cheap, but for the price, not bad.\n",
      "So many lints!! But my son love them\n",
      "I was running out of silver sandals so I decided to go for this beauty. As I know from previous purchases, Walking Cradles makes decent, stylish and comfortable sandals. I was not let down, the sandal fits perfect, looks really pretty, has rich leathery feeling, no straps cutting my toes is an intelligently designed slingback, so you can put them on in seconds and wear them for days on end. Combines well with all my summer dresses, skirts and shorts. May summer never pass :)\n",
      "excelente\n",
      "Comfortable fit, perfect fit, I love this shoe.\n",
      "Love this purse, soft & perfect for every day\n",
      "Love these glasses.  So cute and they fit great.\n",
      "I have severe plantar fasciitis and require prescriptions meds.  I have not been able to walk normally for 6 months and these shoes plus another Sofft shoe have literally been a god send.  In fact I just bought two more pair and I have 3 other pair of Sofft is another style.  These re fantastic!!!!! I feel as though I can run a marathon. The are almost like birkenstocks but without the severe arch support.  These are a lighter arch support but great.  Buy them - you will not regret it.  Also - you can wear this particular pair with skirts.  LOVE THEM.\n",
      "I like it. so comfortable, highly recommend!\n",
      "Love it. Big and roomy. It's  fun and I look forward to using it\n",
      "Perfect size purse..I absolutely love it!!!\n",
      "I tried these on as soon as they arrived. I love them! They fit perfectly and look so cute 😍\n",
      "These are really good shoes. They are nice, soft leather with good, grippy, flexible soles. Momo tends to run a little big for my child's feet, so I ordered the 5.5 instead of the 6 and they fit perfectly.\n",
      "I have always wanted a pair of yeezy's. I've been homeless for quite sometime now and these were definitely a life changer. The price was a little expensive, and being a homeless man, these were not even an option. I was doing some research at my loval burger king and found out that my dog that meant everything to me,  a Duck Tolling Retriever, went for 3000$. So the next day  I took my dog max to the local breeding parture and they offered a solid 3700$ and I took the deal right away. The next day I bought myself a pair of yeezy's and boy although that dog meant a lot to me, i will never regret this decision. Slipping my foot into the each soul made me feel rich. These shoes helped me lose my virginity and get me an office job at a glass company. These shoes have def. changed my life. Love you Max.\n",
      "Great shoe but slightly over-sized and will likely stretch further\n",
      "Great quality!!  Extremely light!!!!\n",

      "Runs very small\n",
      "10 points. everything was as expected\n",
      "Arch support is ok, but the sole does not have much support. Feels like you are walking barefoot.\n",
      "Adorable boots, good for the money...got them as a gift and my sis couldn't be happier!\n",
      "It's light and comfortable, and I like it!\n",
      "I thought this pair of shoes is so nice....... Love it\n",
      "It is larger than expected (or rather longer than expected). It is hard to get into the shoe but once my feet are inside, there are too much space inside it. The top part is flatter than usual, so putting insoles will not work for this. However, i like the style -  it looks unique - rugged and yet with feminine touch. The grey looks darker than expected. My friend saw my shoes and like it so much that she ask me to order one for her too! :)\n",
      "I cardiovascular heavy and after 6 workouts these shoes are my favorite....\n",
      "happy with my new work boots hopefully in about  a year or so we can purchase a new pair threw amazon\n",
      "These shoes are stylish and on trend.  The heel is just right, as I don't feel comfortable in really high heels.\n",
      "Good product but the shoe size is rather smaller than the regular size 40\n",
      "It arrived in time. Fits great!\n",
      "Not the quality I was expecting, but I guess you can't expect much at this very reasonable price. Still, It's lovely, and big enough to hold the contents of my purse. I likely wouldn't buy it again, because of the lower quality, but I like it enough to be happy with my current purchase.\n",
      "Great quality just a little snug and feel they will stretch some.\n",
      "Great Shoes for walking and running, but I ordered a size up as stated by the company and they were to long.\n",
      "Freaking Fantastic!\n",
      "After a few bumps in the road, everything worked out and I couldnt be happier. Kudos to Supplier My Shoes for following up with the<br />USPS and rectifying the problem.<br />The shoes are as advertised and I would buy again.\n",
      "liked my reeboks and they wear well\n",
      "Fast delivery and perfect fit.\n",
      "I bought these a little over a year ago primarily for running, but also as a general use pair for driving, fishing, and other outdoor activity.  Look, they're $30, and I'm not buying them for fashion--I'm buying them for utility.  And to be honest, they did exactly what I expected.  They weren't too tight, but the rubber nose and temples kept them snug on my head so that they didn't shake or slip when running (I don't have a wide head).  And the vision was solid.<br /><br />A month or so ago, I was bummed when the right lens cracked a bit while in my carry-on luggage.  Last week, I noticed that JiMarti offered a warranty on breakage, so I sent an email to the company on their website with a screenshot of my Amazon order.  Today, a replacement pair showed up in the mail.  Thank you, JiMarti!  I'm looking forward to many more months of active use.  They were worth every penny I spent on them.\n",

      "Loved the shoes- very comfortable. The reason I am leaving one star is because after wearing the shoes 4-5 times the strap broke as I was walking. I live in New York, and thankfully I was on my way home, but still had to walk to the train, get on the train and walk home. I hope a fill refund from bass or Amazon.\n",

      "The box came smushed\n",
      "I love these. I love that they are only suede on the sides so I don't have to be quite so conscious of how I step. They are comfortable and because they are nude can be worn with pretty much anything. They are a bit more of a pinky nude, if you have darker skin at all they might not be the true nude shoe you might be looking for. I really love it though because I am super pale and most nudes look like more of a tan on me. ..\n",
      "Bien\n",
      "Nice shoes the only problem is the size, these shoes are small so I have to return the item and ask to change from 10 1/2 to 11 1/2 and now they fit ok\n",
      "I only wear Acsic's and walk 30 miles or more a week. They have great support.\n",

      "Does what they're supposed to do, but a bit bulky for my own taste.\n",
      "You can't go wrong with Stride Rite.  I bought this brand for my kids when they were little and now I buy them for my grand kids.  Always great for toddlers with wide feet.  If buying through Amazon, please know the prices vary among vendors AND prices will vary among the sizes within the same vendor as well.  For instance, occasionally I find that a shoe will be one price for a particular size, but then when I go up a half size, it will be cheaper.  If you love Stride Rite like I do, and you buy them through Amazon, I recommend you shop and compare thoroughly.  My daughter-in-law bought a pair through Amazon Prime and then I found the exact same shoe and size on Amazon Prime, but different vendor, for $11 cheaper.  Luckily the more expensive shoes were easily returnable through Amazon, but it just demonstrates you really need to shop thoroughly.\n",
      "Fast service, true to size, and comfortable. The only thing I'm disappointed about is the wear on the front shoe looks nothing like the picture. It looks like someone just speared a strait line of a lighter color.\n",
      "Beautiful case and great decor! However, my case has a  slight defect so that I cannot close it properly; when this case is closed there is a shift between two parts.\n",
      "Great price, quick shipping, great quality.\n",
      "Great shoes and a great price👍👍👍\n",
      "I love the 1100 series volleyball shoes made by ASICS. I use them for clay court tennis because they fit my foot better than tennis shoes.<br />the toe box it a bit bigger in volleyball shoes....the bottom of the shoe is the same as asics clay court tennis shoes so they do not damage the court surface.<br />Also, I find the price is usually better.\n",
      "Good fit. Very light.\n",
      "The stitching came loose on the front of the boot midway through the first day of wear. They are attractive looking boots, but the craftsmanship is extremely poor. Couldn't believe boots at this price point held up for less than a day.\n",
      "I am usually not a flip flop person but I thought I would give these a try just to wonder around the house and yard in. I actually really like these and am happy I made the purchase. These are more comfortable than many other flip flops I have tried to wear. Would recommend!\n",
      "Looks and feels great. Goes well with my suit.\n",
      "Quite comfortable although the straps are large even with the buckles.  Luckily they aren't necessary to have tight to wear these sandals.  I wore them for 3 or 4 hours and totally forgot I was wearing new sandals/shoes until my mom asked if they were new.  I showed them off proudly even though my mom's eyes were a bit large even as she said how nice they looked.  LOL  Lots of strappy-ness.  Comfortable even on my 63 year old feet.  Its nice they are flat, no wobbling as you walk.\n",
      "The White Cream is perfect for leather shoes!  It goes on easy with a small rag.  It keeps it shine and never looks streaky.  I have<br />used it for years!  It seems to protect my shoes,with other polishes my shoes always cracked after a year.  I give it five stars!\n",
      "Really nice flat boot.  Looks good and feels good too.\n",
      "very nice booths\n",

      "Glad I purchased them the most comfortable clogs ever I wear them all day going up and down stairs and my legs and feet fel great.\n",

      "Size runs small\n",
      "Beautiful clutch purse.love the size and quality too.\n",
      "Soft and comfortable, but my feet often hurt the next day.\n",
      "Love it. It's everything it looks like in the picture and more. Has three pockets inside, the largest one has a zipper so you don't lose your change all over. Better quality than I had expected for the price. this is a medium sized purse. I can fit all my good stuff inside without it being too clunky like a tote. Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "good item\n",
      "Strap shorter than expected\n",
      "Been wearing the shoes for a week. They feel great and seem very durable.\n",
      "Great court shoe & competitive price!  Leave it to Amazon...\n",
      "Despite reviews suggesting that these ran small, I ordered them in a 9, because there were no 9.5s, and I assumed the 10s would be too big. WRONG. My toes hung over the ends of the 9s, they were so small! I returned them and ordered the 10s, which fit perfectly, length wise. I do find that they're a bit loose across the toes, though. Beyond that, these are super comfy and pretty cute, especially for the price.\n",
      "Fits great. Been wearing for about 3 months coaching twice a week. Two complaints.  One, laces are crazy long, had to replace with old laces. Two, upper is very plastic, hard to get good feel of ball.  But hey,  they were only $20.\n",
      "These are well made and stand up to outdoor use. Comfy in the house as well. The slippers are true to size and are a great deal.\n",
      "Awesome fit.\n",
      "I love the style, especially since I've been looking for one with a toe loop for a long time. At first the left shoe was a little more snug than the right  (for whatever reason)  but after wearing them twice, they were broken in and perfect. The brown is quite dark just in case that is not what you're looking for, and the buckles work just fine. I got a size 6 and they fit like a glove.\n",
      "the only thing wrong with these shoes is they squeek when you walk in them. maybe it is the leather, but they do make a noise. other than that i have gotten many remarks about how others like my shoes and ask me if they are comfortable. yes they are comfortable and sturdy with great arch supports for those of us who are on our feets for long hours.\n",
      "Amazing product\n",
      "Good fit, comfortable, and looks great with jeans.\n",
      "Beautiful but little too small\n",

      "I've ordered these shoes before, but had lost them. I LOVE these shoes. Worth every penny. They are true to size!! So comfortable and cute. Love them.\n",
      "It is just as pictured and perfect clutch. It has two chain straps to pick from and is very pretty!\n",
      "Shoes are too big overall.\n",
      "These run very small.  My son could not even get his foot in.  I held them up to his other new shoes and there was over an inch difference.  These come from China and do not have free returns, so I will donate them.  I'm only giving them 2 stars because they are good looking shoes.\n",
      "I wear 11.5 wide in dress shoes, running shoes, cross training shoes, casual shoes and boots.  These were way too narrow and short in 11.5 wide. I'm hesitant to try another size since they were so far off I couldn't even put them on.\n",
      "I was really looking for something bigger.  But that is my fault I should have looked at the measurements.  Picture of girl with bag is deceiving\n",
      "Bought these for a trip to Costa Rica.  We planned on some excursions like river tubing and hiking.  I was able to wear these from one activity to the next.  They dry quickly, I would say a few hours in the sun or overnight in shady conditions.  My only gripe with them was sand, when sand gets in them its difficult to get it out.  Wearing them in the ocean caused them to fill with sand.  You had to remove the shoes and rinse it really well.  I would not suggest them as beach shoes.  I really like that they don't look like typical water shoes.  I have no issue wearing them with or without socks and they are comfortable all day.  I have wider feet and they fit well.\n",
      "Love\n",
      "Said to order 1/2 side and they were right.  Fits perfectly.\n",
      "great little rainboots - great price\n",

      "I love these shoes, very comfortable.\n",
      "This was my second amazon sneaker purchase. Came with original box, new and as described. Checked out the sneakers and it doesn't look or feel fake to me. That would be a hell of a good job if they were fake. Runs true to size. Some people may feel a little rubbing on the pinky toe. A lot of Jordan's come like that. There made to break in over a long period of walking or fit like dress shoes. However, if that bothers you, I would half size up.  Glad to see Amazon have retro Jordan's! The price is a little higher than released. Not to drastic. This is what you pay when you miss the release dates or if its exclusive for a limited time. I still cant believe people paid thousands of dollars for patent leathers back in the days. The cheapest price was like $2,500 for used ones to like $8,000 for new ones.\n",
      "The boots were nice, but I returned them due to small fit.\n",
      "Well over all it turned out okay, but I wasn't pleased with promptness or the lack of communication. Therefore the 3\n",
      "I needed a western boot for a country-western theme party and I was looking for a great price, DONE! The fit was exactly as described in the ad, and this boot looks as pictured. Yes, it is long and pointy in the toe, the expected look of a dress-boot. Because it was such a low price, I half-expected trouble with the fit and with the quality, but both were top-notch. I am pleased with this purchase.\n",
      "I loved this shoes and I hope purchase but the shipping it's very expensive, I would like to  make the purchase free . I  will be grateful to you 😚\n",
      "Perfect for Golf beginner.\n",
      "These are the 6th or 7th Asic Gels I've owned....if you have a wide foot make sure to get the wide.  Otherwise these are great all around shoes.\n",
      "One of the best shoes I have ever worn.  I do wish they had just a little thicker  insole but that is probably just me. &#34;This is how I felt when I bout this shoe to the point I bought another pair. These fabric shoes is week and in one month they developed a hole in them so know my other pair may have to be house shoes. I really had high hopes for this model.\n",
      "Shoes ran very small....should order a full size or size and a half larger\n",
      "Perfect fit great very comfortable and shipped quickly very happy\n",
      "I love it. That's all that I can say.<br />But unfortunately, I had no notification from amazon\n",

      "I've undergone Plantar Faciial release surgery on both feet, the Vionics shoes I've recently purchased are working great. Comfortable,\n",

      "I have 3 pairs, and my feet love them!\n",
      "Love the bottle opener!\n",
      "Really cute little purse, looks just like the image in person. There is something about it that makes it look just a little bit lunch-boxy (although it's too narrow to be used for that really), but it's really super cute for anyone of any age I think.\n",
      "I cannot possibly be the only one who's getting tired of the &#34;hand stitched&#34; advertisement that comes with Born shoes. I own 12 pairs of Born sandals and every one of them after about 3 months has the same problem - the bottom sole separates from the insole. Yes they both have stitching but are not stitched together but glued. If they were not so comfortable I would have given up a long time ago; but due to foot problems Born shoes are the only ones I can wear. Please Born.....at least use a glue that lasts!!!\n",
      "The silver detail on the heel is cool but unfortunately that's all that I can say that is positive. The shoes are extremely tight and I can't wear them. The material of the shoe is sort of quilted and it doesn't have a nice finish. I would NOT recommend these shoes to anyone.\n",
      "I bought an evening back that had a long gold shoulder strap, not, fan of all chain straps and found this one that works perfect.  It sits at the perfect length under my arm...\n",
      "Firmer than expected.\n",
      "I needed a 20 slot wallet I am pleased to find one at this price. That being said, I would have gladly paid more for one of better quality overall.\n",
      "These are perfect! Very groovy!\n",
      "These shoes are perfect! So perfect I'm buying another pair today. I'm a size 7. It fits like a glove. It runs a bit small but I'm sure after a few wears it will fit as it should. Very happy!\n",
      "These I bought for my daughter. She Has told me that they are the nicest sunglasses she has had. States the make things outside on bright days much clearer and has no eye strain. VERY HAPPY\n",
      "It is ok!\n",
      "These are my favorite boots!\n",
      "Only reason for giving less than 5 stars is that they need to Hi-Light that these son glasses have a very large bridge and will not fit most people.  Black fly's are an excellent manufacturer of shades though.\n",
      "These run very small \u001a\n",
      "I haven't worn these boots yet, but tried them on and they fit; I know nine west shoes/boots run a little small so I ordered a 9.5 instead of my normal size 9. They are slippery so I  added  the anti-slip pads on the bottom of them.\n",
      "Good boots not non slip through. For the price they are surprisingly comfortable\n",
      "They feel like you're walking on pillows. They are a bit warm to wear in this heat wave but all speakers are. Looking forward to wearing on my daily mile when it cools down.\n",
      "Cheaply made\n",
      "Good fitted shoe. Wears well.\n",
      "Perfect fit, very comfortable, great price. No complains here.\n",
      "The shoe was too small, returned and havent replaced it with a larger size. Cant say much about the shoe since she didnt didnt fit in it, but she seemed to really like the style and it was very light weight.\n",
      "I have several pairs of Climacool running shoes so I had to try their golf shoes. They are light and breathable. I like them!\n",
      "My daughter really liked the shoes and she wears them all day, every day!\n",
      "Ever since I broke my foot 3 yeas ago I have needed supports in my shoes to be able to walk and stand comfortably. I started buying Crocs to use for around the house and to run errands. They were ideal for me right from the start. They provide perfect support for both my now healed foot and my other foot.  I also wanted some Crocs that didn't look like the famous original Crocs.  This design is ideal for me. It looks like a regular canvas shoe but with the famous support and feel of original crocs.\n",
      "This is my second pair of these shoes.  On e of the most comfortable and longest wearing shoes I have owned. The new pair feels slightly larger than my original pair, but still are satisfactory.\n",
      "When I first tried them on, they felt like I might get a blister from rubbing in certain areas.. however no blister ever formed and they basically molded to my feet. I have flat feet and they are great.\n",
      "Loved it when I first got it. Has lots of room and is super cute but the stitching came apart and I  couldn't use it after like a month.\n",
      "I have a number of pairs of reef sandals.  The strap on these is not as soft as some of the other models.\n",
      "I absolutely love these shoes! I wore them standing/walking 16-hours a day and they are truly comfortable. I only gave the product a three star rating because after 6-9 months of wearing them the insoles began to slip up towards the heel making them uncomfortable/unwearable. I may have wore them down quickly and wished they lasted longer.\n",
      "To tight, sent them back\n",
      "This is my second time buying these shoes. Very comfortable and goes with just about anything. They can be casual or dressy.\n",
      "They are great! Fits as expected and look brand new:)\n",
      "great shoes, very happy with them!\n",
      "cute shoe but too narrow for my sons feet.  If your child has chubby or wide feet, good luck getting them to fit.  I even bought a half size bigger so he would have some room to grow into them.\n",
      "These boots are amazing! They're perfect for the fall season!\n",
      "Comfortable and true to size.\n",
      "bastante bueno.\n",
      "Very comfortable love this shoes\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "I would give them 5 stars but they are just too narrow and they don't make cycling shoes wide.  I bought them a little big and they  feel great.\n",
      "Fits extremely well, has a very comfortable feel. I turned around and bought a backup. The manufacture always change style.\n",
      "Have not worn the boots yet.  But did try on to see if they fit with thick socks, as they did.  I ordered a size-up so I could wear the boots with socks.<br />I was surprised the boots were matt leather since I was expecting shiny leather, however I am sure after a few polishings they will look more weathered.  I have high arches and bunions so find boots/shoes hard to fit me.  However, these boots seem really comfortable.  I will wear them in the fall when the weather gets cooler.\n",
      "I love my boot\n",
      "Not as shinny as the picture and a little snug, but not a bad value at the price\n",
      "Great product!  Arrived on time\n",
      "They were cheap, but made poorly. They rub my feet at the seams,  and the vinyl has a rubbery feel.\n",
      "I bought this to replace my failing Croakies ARC wire cord and it works much better. The ball at the end of the strap allows this to adjust the length of the strap as well as act as a weight for the strap to rest against the back of my neck. Note that these will only work with small and thin frames.\n",
      "Fantastic pair of shoes! Will wear them at least a year if not more!\n",
      "They aren't sneakers but these balls help the ones you own smell good. I also use them in my boat shoes.\n",
      "I love these flips.  I only buy this brand.  They do fall apart after some use (maybe 6 months) but I wear everyday. So I buy more.  Cute design and very comfortable.\n",
      "Smelt sooo weird\n",
      "Great shoe I love them there suede really nice and they came 3 days early thanks amazon\n",
      "The shoe is long and narrow, so it was not a good fit. It seems well built, but I retuned it because it was just not comfortable.\n",
      "I receive compliments of these when worn, but find I don't reach for them very often, because they are quite wide. I have always worn an average width. They aren't unwearable, but if you don't like a wider shoe, skip these.\n"

      "The shoe just did not look good on my feet. Looked very flat on the instep. However, overall it's a really cute shoe, the fit was good, possibly a bit wide for my slighlty narrow foot. I am a 10-10.5, often need an 11 in closed toe, and the 11 was correct for me. I think it would look cuter on a wider shorter foot. Seemed to have good support and cushioning.\n",
      "The look of the shoe is a solid, clean look.  I like that a lot.  They are comfy, cushy, and light just like the old Free Run 2's.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for the same arch support you got in the original 2.0's, don't buy these shoes.  I have been on a mission to find a pair like the original Free Run 2's because my old ones are super worn out and the new 5.0's have horrible arch support.  I thought and hoped I'd found the right shoes here, but I didn't.<br /><br />If you don't have high arches these might be great shoes for you because the support in these 2's is still better than the 5.0's.  However, if you ARE like me and you have high arches, I don't recommend these shoes.  The support is insufficient and you will probably hurt your shins or your feet (depending on how you step).\n",
      "OHHH my new favorite flip flop ever!! Just ripped open my package and put on my new flip flops and don't want to take them off! They are literally the most comfortable flip flops I have ever had, more comfortable than reefs and fit flops.  They are cushy, and soft and don't rub anywhere like others do.  Size fits perfectly.  I love the logo detailing on the inside of the straps too.   Can't wait to get another pair.\n",

I throw shot-put and discus. it supported my foot perfectly with throughout all of my different throws. if you're a thrower and don't want to pay for super expensive shoes these are great especially if you use a south African throw for discus. if you looking for a dance shoe I would also recommend these as I do actually use the for my dance class at the gym. the only problem is that they are a little too big and you don't have much time to exchange them. my where delivered a few days late so i was unable to exchange them for the right size so if you are going to buy these buy half a size smaller. I wear am 8 but I should have bought a 7.5.\n",
      "Very Happy with the new Gel-Kayano 22's.  Like the 21's, these are very comfortably cushioned at the heel and fore foot.  The toe-box is snug and the heel counter provides great support.  I am a mid-foot runner and these allow and guide you to stay in line and I don't notice the high 12 mm toe drop, it actually feels lower that that, which is a good thing for me.  At 10.9 ounces the shoe feels light and great for my tempo runs.  I'm training for a marathon in November '15 and I'm happy these came out for me to train in and use for the race.  I've already logged 100+ miles on these Kayano 22's and so far it's been very durable.  I've also ran in the rain in them and they have pretty good traction.  I'm definitely going to buy 2 or more pairs as I love these shoes!  Everything I expected in the shoes from Asics!\n",

I absolutely LOVE these shoes snd the color! NOTE: The blue is actually brighter than pictured but that's even better. Overall im pleased with the comfort style and shipping speed and will order again soon.\n",

      "As for comfort these shoes are fantastic. However I question how long they'll last since after wearing them for just one day then left shoe started coming apart where there outsole is attached to the toe. I would be way more bothered had I paid full price but since this item was discounted and I'm pretty sure no longer in production, I guess I can only complain a little. Very comfortable and I'll buy new balance again, just not the minimus.\n",

Personally needing much more support for long term comfort, my go to slipper is Fit Flops, also available on amazon.  For the general public I think the support would be good.  Having tried on Croc slippers in the stores, I note they vary greatly in the height of the arch, the height of the heel and overall comfort.\n",

      "Love these shoes.  They look great, feel great and fit just as expected!\n",
      "These were for my granddaughter and she's the one that loves and wears them a lot.\n",

      "Really nice sandal! I might be happier if the sole were a bit more cushioned, but I'm not going to quibble. It is cushioned, and well supported, and very comfortable, and what I was looking for.<br />Be aware: Although it does have three adjustable velcro-closure straps, two of the straps are redundant for non-adjustable straps in the same places (the heel strap and the toe strap). Usually I stay away from sandals with non-adjustable straps, because of the width of my feet, but these straps give very ample room in the 3E size -- the ankle strap bit more so than the toe strap..[[ASIN:B00ED7JX1S Propet Men's Anderson Sandal,Black/Grey,13 3E US]]\n",
      "Small\n",
      "Exactly what I was looking for - right size and full zipper on top to close.  Needed something to carry my extra change of clothes etc for flight and wanted something that would stuff under the seat but not let everything fall out.\n",
      "My twin toddlers have feet that are more narrow than most, so it's usually a struggle to find shoes that aren't too wide. These fit the width of their feet perfectly and are lightweight. These are also very cute shoes and nicely priced!! Very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "i like it! it is my size, it is comfortable for me, and it is look very good! I am satisfied with my order!\n",
      "Good insoles with lots of arch support.  Normally I don't wear shoes for a long period of time as I am retired so I can't say how comfortable they would be if worn all day.  From my experience I would say that they would be better than no arch support.\n",
      "Best shoes ever\n",

      "I have always loved these shoes. No one in their right mind would SUE because they didn't lose weight wearing them. They help my calves tremendously. I am hard on shoes & these will last me to the end of May. I am a Custodian & I will always buy Skechers as long as they are available & I can afford them! Thank you so much for having them ready & &#34;waiting&#34; for me!!! Love you Amazon!  Barb Z.\n",

      "Thank you. Fun shoe\n",
      "If you have foot problems these are the best flip flops out there.  And the shoes by this company are great too!<br />I've had my fit flops since July and just three days ago they broke, the strap between the toes.  I just call The Gear Coop and left them a message.  I ask for a replacement pair since I've only had them less than 5 months.  I wear them everyday because they are the most comfortable shoes I own!\n",
      "Wonderful quality.  I purchased 2 of these elastic straps to add additional elastic to my daughter's pointe shoes for ballet.  They provided the needed support.  They weren't exactly the same color as the elastic on the Bloch pointe shoes that we purchased, but they were very close.  They were shipped the same day and arrived very quickly.\n",
      "Too small.  About 1/2 size. No support. Daughter liked.\n",
      "I love this purse. It looks smaller in the pictures.. it pretty big, overall great purchase and great price.\n",
      "these nb shoes are incredibly comfortable and well sized. i worked on my feet all day indoors on cement today and my feet felt great, never got that soreness in my lower legs/knees or tightness in quads like i do when on my feet for 6 to 8 hours.<br />the memory top insert is the first thing you feel when slipping these on. it feels like youre sliding your feet into a glove.<br />wow, and for the $ these were the best shoe pickup ive ever had. (i ordered a 10 and fit perfect.)<br /><br />i recommend these to a anyone doing a variety of activities throughout a day.<br />so comfortable\n",
      "Ordered in narrow and fit perfectly.  grasshoppers have been around for a long time and I can always depend on them fitting great and being comfortable from the first time I wear them.  It is difficult to find arrow shoes now days, but you can always find narrow Grasshoppers.  Thank goodness.  great everyday, comfortable shoe!\n",
      "Changed colors and shoes no longer match.  Look at the photos.  One is grey while one is brown-ish... I've hand washed them and it hasn't helped.  Looks like they used a different material on the front.  Fits great.\n",
      "good purchase for a great price!!!\n",
      "Glad to find these shoestrings.  A bit expensive, but shipping and handling do that, I guess.\n",

      "I love the Original SWAT Metro boots, they are hands down the most comfortable boots on the market right out of the box. I bought two pairs to rotate every other day so that they don't wear as quickly. I've used boots from 5.11, Magnum, Bates, Thorogood, Danner, Converse, Oakley and Under Armour but for comfort Original SWAT is the winner. Even though they are comfortable after one year of daily use (with rotation) the sole is starting to separate from the boot at the heel on both pairs. I suppose that 6 months is about the average lifespan of most boots where the sole is glued to the boot but I did expect that they would last longer because I rotated both pairs every other day. I had a similar problem with the Original Swat Chase boots after about the same amount of time. I tried the Winx2 boots but they were uncomfortable and not even close to the metro comfort wise. If you are ok with replacing your boots every 6 months then these are great, if not I'd go with a boot that can be re-soled.<br /><br />*** Update 11/26/15 ***<br />Recently the side zipper broke on one of my pairs during my shift rendering the boot useless. The other pair is still functional but one boot has developed a squeak even when walking on non-smooth surfaces. Though I love the comfort of these boots, I won't be purchasing side zip boots anymore and may consider a different brand as replacing boots every 6 months gets old, and expensive.\n",
      "Great, comfortable shoe!\n",
      "I recomend all Birkenstock shoes.\n",
      "Wrong color so I returned it\n",
      "Very nicely made and pretty comfortable to wear too. Will buy again soon!\n",
      "Nice product.  Sizes run on the small side. I normally wear a US size 11 and I had to exchange for a size 12.\n",
      "I am sending this bag back. It is much smaller than described on the site. I can fit a 70 sheet notebook in here, and that's it. It is definitely not functional for work unless all you need to carry around is a notebook and a pen.\n",
      "Shipping was fast... runs big my baby is 6 months with big feet her feet is 4.5' so I ordered 0-6 months and fits perfect with a lil room to grow... I ordered in beige they look so cute on my baby\n",
      "My second pair and I will definitely be buying a 3rd! Excellent shoe, washable, and comfortable. My first pair has lasted one year so far and still going strong.\n",
      "I just got my boots so haven't tried them out in winter weather yet.  I have very wide feet and was also concerned about the fit around the leg/calf.  I usually wear 7-1/2 to 8, so to accommodate a heavy sock, I ordered 8.5 WW.  The fit is fine, in the leg and foot length,  but beware, as mentioned in another review, the toe area tends to be a bit narrow, even with a WW boot size.  I'm sure they'll be fine if I wear a thinner sock as they are a very well insulated boot so warmth should not be an issue.\n",
      "Love it very nice came early\n",
      "Comfy shoe used for walking several miles per day for exercise.  Love the gel in the ball of the foot and the rear--not many shoes have gel in the front.  Replaced the GT-2000 with these to try and so far am happy with them.  Had to bump up 1/2 a size from the GT-2000, so they feel slightly large, but not uncomfortable.\n",
      "He liked the shoes but he said they were too tight at the toes. I am going to order a size bigger.\n",
      "Great Style.\n",
      "They arrived fast & were beautiful!  I bought them as a gift and she loved them. Now I want a pair for me! :-)\n",

      "My second pair of Meleen Crocs...so comfortable...love them!\n",
      "The shoes are comfortable.\n",
      "Bought a half size bigger since they run small and they fit great. Good price for Junior volleyball shoes which are so hard to find. Very satisfied.\n",
      "I've purchased at least 3 pairs of Pedipeds per year for the last 7 years. My daughter loves the fit and the quality has been outstanding until now. She wore the Bailey model last year, but this year I purchased the Anna model for her school uniform shoe. After 1 week ( 5 wears), my 2nd grader's shoes were peeled badly. She did not touch them or peel them; she didn't even notice until I showed her. But the material is peeled all the way off the first third of the show and the shoe looks ratty. Extremely disappointing.\n",
      "This was my first RYKA. Purchased one more last week. And contemplating another! They fit me better than the lavishly priced Nike/Pumas..\n",
      "nice shoes\n",
      "Arrived as expected\n",
      "I have wide feet and I'm also 5ft 10&quot; so finding shoes that fit are always a challenge. Nine West is one of the few good brands that carries a 10.5 which is my actual size. Most brands go from 10 to 11 - size 11 isn't a perfect fit for me (only works if the brand runs small). I love these shoes! Wore them for a 10hr day and got so many compliments and they were so comfortable. Definitely a great buy!\n",
      "I'm very satisfied with my new shoes. However, I am more impressed on how easy the return process was. I really like the fact that I received my new shoes without having to wait until you received my previous ones.\n",
      "Very narrow sandals even though i order bigger size than the size chart advice me . The sandals straps are hard , there are not flexible with your feet motion or movement . The front is really narrow and it an give pain in the sides bones of your feet . I don not recommend this sandals for wide feet people . I test them in wet floor and they are really slippery you could fall .   If any one knows a sandals brand that have wide size please let me know thank you\n",
      "Can't wear with pants tucked in because I have a wide calf but other than that they are great boots. Wore them today to work and it made tromping through the rain pleasurable.\n",
      "These sandals felt good right away. The strap over my toes started to annoy my<br />foot a bit after wearing them 4-5 hours. I like them a lot though.\n",
      "Very nice bag. Better tgan i expected.\n",
      "I had to return the original pair as too small but I ordered half size bigger\n",

      "my boy loves them!\n",
      "I'm used to wearing very minimal Merrell barefoot shoes, so I was surprised by how large these Sketchers make my feet look!  The flexible sole is what sold me on them, over other nursing shoes, such as clog styles.  The flexible sole is comfortable; the memory foam insoles are very comfortable and are removable.  The non-fabric upper is appropriate for the medical field.  Overall these shoes work great.  I have high arches and plan to add an arch cookie for when I have to spend many hours on my feet.  My only complaint is that the material listing is misleading: it should not mention the word &#34;leather&#34;, as there is no leather - &#34;man-made&#34; or &#34;synthetic&#34; is all they should specify!  I thought they meant the upper had both synthetic and leather pieces.  I would definitely recommend these to people who need white non-fabric work shoes.\n",
      "I work on concrete surfaces from 8 - 10 hours every day. These shoes are extremely comfortable and fit well.\n",
      "Excellent!\n",
      "Chose these shoes based on the similarity of a pair that I already owned and loved.  True to size and style, these are perfect for me with good arch support for my daily treadmill workout.\n",
      "I spite of the fact that the package was well protected, there was a hairline scratch, which I debated whether or not to exchange or return.  A little disappointed that it was also smaller than displayed.\n",
      "I like the shoes a lot, very comfortable - that said, TAKE THE ADVICE OF THE OTHER POSTERS!  I wear a 9.5 in Foot Joy shoes...thankfully I went to 10.5 in these at the advice of others, and they fit great.  MAYBE I could have gotten 10s, but 9.5 would have been way small.  So, I don't know if it's Foot Joy or Puma with the error, but use this as your guide if you're coming from FJs.  These shoes are very comfortable for sure!\n",
      "Ive done my research and these boots are hard core great. If I could only find them in women friendly sizes? I cant find them in Womens, (HELCOR) so im trying to match my size up with mens sizing. Im a solid 8in wmns, and Tims run big so unfortunately im returning these. Boo. I really hope these find a home since they are great for snow, mud/water, scuff and rough workwear, and stylish! The HELCOR material these Timberlands are made of are seriously unbreakable. So you don't even have to baby your boots and worry about getting them messed up. They can take care of themselves, and they will take good care of your feet!\n",
      "Exelent boots\n",
      "MATERIAL COMING OFF HEEL AND A BAD CHEMICAL SMELL AND VERY NARROW\n",
      "They are nice sandals with a cute design. I have another pair of the Sanuk basic black yoga mat flip flops, and the sizing is a little different. These ones run a little bit smaller, but look a little more\n",

      "I have been wearing this exact same brand and size for years. My other pair was looking pretty shoddy so I ordered another pair. This pair runs small and is very uncomfortable, I have tried &#34;breaking them in&#34;, but sadly, they are simply too small. Again, I have an identical pair that fits perfectly, so not sure what has happened...regardless, I now have a pair of $59 shoes that I cannot wear :(\n",
      "Cute shoes! Fit nicely for a petite 9 year old girl.\n",
      "They look great.  No binding around the ankles.  Very comfortable.  Would've been nice to have some arch support with the platform because the shoes do not bend as you walk, the soles don't flex, however the footbed is very soft.  As I write this I'm a bit indecisive about keeping them for the no-flexibility reason...but the shoes look so-oooo good and the camel color is awesome!  I am so torn...\n",

      "Love these Zumba shoes! Can move around without pain in my feet. Not recommended for walking.\n",

      "Love them! True to size. Arrived quicker than expected.\n",
      "I've been waiting to buy these boots for weeks, and it stinks that they were way too small. I even went up a half size, but color and style are pictured well.\n",
      "Super cute but very narrow!\n",
      "Love this! I have wide flat feet and bunions, even though I typicall wear 7 1/2 I ordered a size 7 because Vionic reduces over-probation, and naturally realigns your feet over wear. It fits perfectly, and since I love the other pairs so much, I've order a few other vionic slippers, wedges, and sandals.\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "Love this shoe. And the seller was great.\n",
      "My feet are currently enjoying these shoes, every day for a week now. These are my everyday, in and out shoes for puttering, playing with the dog, etc.  I ordered two sizes, the usual half size up based on feedback in reviews, and my regular size. I have to return the regular size, too short. The fleece lining is thick, certainly takes up room, but after a week I can say the half size up is perfect. Suede stretches, the fleece compacts, so far so good.  Arch support is decent, weight is good, soles very nice. I am pleased with these. They are cute, too.\n",
      "I have always been happy with this shoe. They last forever. Also very comfortable .\n",
      "Gorgeous! Heel is not too high. Quite comfy (but different from regular shoes)\n",
      "Great value.\n",
      "do not it as well as other skecher scandal that I purchased.\n",
      "Love, love, love it!  The leather is super soft.  2 main compartments really help me to organize all the junk I carry around with me.  So glad I bought this.  Would buy a second in a heartbeat!\n",
      "I've been looking for comfortable shoes for some time. The term &#34;relaxed fit&#34; for these shoes is very appropriate. They aren't loose and fit very comfortably; regular width shoes can often be uncomfortable for people with arthritis. They are light, and handle hot temperatures well (I live where summer temps are often above 100 F). I recommend these highly if you have had difficulty with the usual regular width shoes.\n",
      "beautifull color, i really fall in love, but it is too small, i really dessappoint\n",

      "My daughter normally wears AFO's and is unable to stand or walk without them. I was looking for something for her to wear around the house, for short distances, without needing to wear all the AFO gear. Unfortunately for her, the memo sandals still didn't give her little ankle the support she needs to feel comfortable walking. They are so so cute. High quality shoes. I'm sad they didn't work for us\n",

      "These were very chic as expected. Love them!\n",
      "It is ok. Not the best quality. The pros are that it is light and comfortable but don't expect to walk in it for hours.\n",
      "i like them.\n",
      "I love these shoes and I own three pairs.  HOWEVER, two out of three pairs in less than one season have started to fall apart.  It's almost like they went short on the amount that was tucked under and sewed in as the cloth on the footbed starts to pull away become untucked.  You also definitely do not want to come in contact with any water, as the falling apart process will accelerate.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Just right for a travel bag.\n",
      "It looked ok, but the zipper always got stuck and the lining behind the card slots came out. Waste of money.\n",
      "I´m very dissatisfy with this shoes, it´s running TOO NARROW on fingers, I´m been buying cole haan for the 19th last years, and this is the first pair with this problem for me, it´s impossible to use.\n",
      "They are cute.  I gave them to my daughter because they are too small.  They are wide as well.  My daughter and I have narrow feet.  They are comfortable.  For somebody with a wide foot, I would say order a size up and you could walk around Disneyland all day.\n",
      "I love this bag although mine differs from the current image!<br />Amazing quality in every way!\n",
      "My daughter loved these!\n",

      "PRO: These shoes are super cute. They look great, and seem to match with everything. As with most Tom's shoes they are generally very comfortable.<br /><br />CON: The picture of these were green. They're not. They are beige. I looked it up and since no green version of this shoe exists, I kept it. However hopefully others realize when they are buying not to trust the picture.<br /><br />CON: I have semi-wide feet and they are a bit tight on the sides and pinch a little. If you have slender feet, they would probably be the most comfortable shoes ever, however if you have slightly wider feet, just be prepared they will pinch. If you have wide feet? I wouldn't consider these shoes at all, otherwise you would have very angry feet after wearing them.\n",
      "Very comfy!! Great shoe! I can wear these all day with no pain!\n",
      "I would buy again\n",
      "Love at first sight!!! I'm a Gucci girl and these are perfect. My sister and I rock them!!\n",
      "The only downside to these super cute shoes is wearing them in wet weather. The sole of the shoe becomes very slick and your foot will slide out so I don't recommend wearing them in the rain or if you know it will be raining. Otherwise, I love them and get a lot of compliments.\n",
      "Works great for a floor installer who rips apart the toes on all work shoes until these\n",
      "Very comfortable shoe. My only problem is I really need a larger toe box due to the orthotic I need to wear but the shoe itself is great !  It's supportive and very light weight.\n",

      "I bought these slippers in a size Medium from another retailer and they were a bit shorter in the toe than I expected.  I normally wear an 8 to 8.5 shoe.  That said, they're made very well - durable leather suede with thick wool shearing throughout the inside (very soft - not itchy at all).  I gave the Medium's to my daughter who pretty much claimed them when I discovered they were too short in the toes for my feet, and she rarely wants to have them off of her feet when home.  The same daughter rarely ever wanted to wear slippers that she had in the past - she loves these that much (which makes me happy as the floor of our basement duplex apartment can get very chilly in winter). I have since purchased a size Large of these slippers from Amazon so I can have my own pair.  I love them and totally recommend them.  Note - although they are not constructed with a 'non-slip' style bottom (the bottoms are made of the same leather suede that the rest of the outer walls are made with), they (so far) have not been slippery at all, even on the smooth kitchen floor.\n",

      "I bought these shoes in black last year and really liked them.  I needed a pair of these same shoes in red this year, but everyone was out of this color.  Then, I thought of Amazon and they had my size in red.  These sandal can be worn for casual or dressy.  I also like the fact that they have velcro adjustable straps.\n",

      "love chacos and always wear them BUT... this brand was the first one that actually broke down on me.  the side straps DO NOT go all the way through, like they do on the unaweep models.  if the strap is not connected, it WILL pull out at some point.  this did.<br /><br />  we shoved the strap back in where it pulled out using a butter knife and then shot in some gorilla glue (only thing available).  it worked temporarily and had to be done again.  the last time, the gorilla glue expanded to form a lump.  we crushed it down, so now, they seem to be holding.  still, its just a matter of time.<br /><br />  chacos are a great brand, but stick with the z1 or the z2 if you *really* use them.\n",
      "Good product ...<br />Price are bit expensive\n",
      "These are gorgeous shoes! I ultimately returned because I found another pair I fell in love with, but the choice was not easy! Would have loved to have more occasions to wear such a lovely shoe because I would have kept if I thought I could get reasonable use out of them. Fits true to size.\n",
      "Best buy ever!!\n",
      "Wayfarer style.  They look great. Lenses are a little cheap (plastic) but for the price they are perfectly appropriate, especially since they are polarized.  Great for driving or by the pool.  Kept one pair, gave one to my wife.  Would definitely buy again!  Please note these are MATTE finish.  Turns out I like that better than glossy but was surprised when first opening.\n",

      "Although I put it as Fit as expected, This is because it is as what a size 5 while i am more of a 4.5M. So it is slightly loose for me. I wish they make smaller size shoes though.<br />Overall, it has a nice professional look, and is comfortable. The quality looks good.<br />The white is white so that is one key reason why i like it.\n",

      "I was only disappointed in the color.  I was looking for burgundy, when it came. it's much lighter than the picture.\n",
      "It's a great shoe. They look exactly like the picture shows. I have no complaints. I would recommend taking into consideration the fact that you won't be wearing socks when selecting the correct size. The sizes run the same as all other Adidas shoes. I wear an 11.5 in Adidas and I bought an 11.5 not really thinking about the fact that I wouldn't be wearing socks. It's slightly loose, but still okay to me. I might get a 1/2 size smaller next time.\n",

Of course you can use the little tie in the front to tighten the shoe around the foot. So with this, they work well! And they came in the cutest box. Now her feet won't get dirty in our mommy and me class :) (she's only 2.5yrs)\n",

      "These slippers were given as a gift and my dad absolutely loves them.<br /><br />As is characteristic with these types of slippers, the rawhide &#34;shoe laces&#34; on the front don't always want to stay tied when you cross your feet while laying in the recliner.  My suggestion to my dad was apply a small dab of wood glue or Gorilla glue to the knot and snug the knot up tight - that should hold it in place.  I've done that before on similar styles of slippers and it's worked fine.  This minor issue is not a problem with this specific L.B. Evans slipper, but rather this style of shoe/slipper so no deduction of stars here.<br /><br />While my dad has only been wearing them for a few days now, he says that they appear to be very well constructed and are very comfortable.  He doesn't wear socks with his house slippers so these fit very well in his normal shoe size and he loves the fleece lining.  All in all, in his estimation, they are outstanding slippers and, in my opinion, they were priced right!\n",

      "Just tested these out this weekend hiking and they are so comfortable. I'm a size 10 but ordered a 10.5 as I was recently on a long hike with size 10 sneakers and towards the end the downhill was killing my toes. Just enough extra room. Buy these!\n",

I would have worked on stretching them out, but I chose this style specifically because I wanted a pair without straps. So...fail.\n",
      "I've purchased many pairs of Fit Flops.  I love them!\n",

      "I wanted these to work, but the front toe strap was much too narrow.  I have a foot that is on the wide side and I couldn't even get my toes to the front of the shoe because the leather strap is so narrow.  The leather is very stiff and not pliable so I am not sure if they would have stretched out.\n",

      "Great fit & very comfortable\n",
      "I wear a 9.5 in most closed toe shoes. These fit ok in a 9.5 but with a reg sock my big toe was hitting the end when I walked. I returned the 9.5 and got the 10 and it is a much better fit with a hiking sock. The thin insoles were easily removed and I replaced them with an OTC orthotic sport type insole and this is perfection. I can't wait to get out and hike in them this fall. Great purchase! If you like a little more toe room or like to wear a thicker hiking sock go up 1/2 size. I don't think you would be sorry, and at this price?! Wowzaa!\n",

      "Love the look, but the fit is a bit weird. Started with an 8 (my normal size) and they looked way too bug, but the bottom straps were tight. Sized down to a 7.5, and had the same problem. These are just very long and skinny shoes - beautiful, but an odd fit...\n",
      "Nice looking.  Like the organizer.  Great value.\n",
      "Looks exactly like the photo. BUT! The color was a little off.<br />I got the rose red and it came to be more of a dark fusha color. Still cute though. Shoes feels light and it's very comfortable. Also, shoes was perfect fitting. I wear a size 9 so I got a size 9. PERFECT!  Definitely a keeper.\n",

      "This is a wonderful shoe.  Fits well (I have very narrow feet), super comfortable and light.  I'm happy to pay the extra for a product that is made in the USA.  So why 2 stars?<br /><br />I have worn this model for several years.  The first ones started to smell like cat urine (the outside of the soles near the heel) after a few months wear.  New Balance replaced the first pair TWICE at no charge, saying a problem with some adhesive caused the shoes to develop an odor similar to cat urine.  This year, they decided they would not replace them since they were way outside warranty.  That is perfectly understandable.  So I bought a new pair in January, 2015.  Seven months later, one shoe started to have that cat urine-like smell again.  It was only on the outside.  So I contacted New Balance again.  Here is their response:<br /><br />&#34;I am sorry you are experiencing an odor issue with your 990 shoes. I understand in the past we mentioned the odor issue is caused by an adhesive in the shoes. I would like to correct what we have told you in the past. After research and testing we have found the adhesive was not the issue in the odor issue. What we have found the odor is from moisture getting trapped in the shoe and the shoe not being able to completely dry out. The odor does take time to develop within the shoe if not completely dried out before the next wearing.<br /><br />The 990 shoe does have a less breathable upper which makes it harder for the shoe to completely dry out before the next wearing vs. shoes that have a mesh upper are able to dry out at a faster rate than the 990 shoes. We have also found the best way to dry out the shoes is to remove the insoles, loosen the laces, and pull the tongue forward. This is the best way to dry out the shoes to help prevent the odor issue.&#34;<br /><br />Thanks, New Balance, for the explanation.  But please ponder this.  One shoe of my current pair (7 months old) has that odd smell on the OUTSIDE of the sole, not the inside.  If it is a moisture issue, why doesn't the inside smell like the outside?  So far that question has not been explained to me by New Balance. And I don't believe I have exceptionally sweaty feet.  Plus, this has not been an issue in any other shoe I own.<br /><br />Again, these shoes are not cheap.  And I will gladly pay for US-made shoes.  And the fit and comfort are exceptional.  But please consider the odor issue when purchasing.\n",
      "Amazing classic shoe that makes me feel like a white person from the northeast!\n",
      "Great Shoes for cheer\n",
      "Just recieved these and was kinda nervous ordering online before trying them on first, but I absolutely love them!!! Color of these are awesome and they fit perfectly. Nice case that comes with them also definitely a thumbs up!\n",

      "The Skechers were recommended by my physician to help heal my plantar fasciitis.  The first pair I bought several years ago had the sole separate and fall apart. I decided to try again. The pair I bought a month ago are falling apart on the inside. The liner is tearing and shredding. I hope they will last another month since they cost over $100.\n",
      "Sent them back, to tight\n",
      "3 stars at best, took these on a few light duty trails and they were fine, not as much cushioning as my aging feet like but they were decent. Brought them on a fairly serious hike on Glen Boulder Trail -&#62; Mt. Isolation up in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, ran most of the way, I'm an aggressive descender and weigh in about 190#'s. Several of the lugs ripped off and they look like shoes that have about 200+ miles on them after at most 35 miles, most of the wear was from one hike/run, plus the feet were killing me from the strike toe strike area really not doing much absorption. I can't see why these are rated so high, I wish I could have my money back, total waste... These were a total let down. They might be fine for someone lighter and less aggressive on the gnarly stuff but for my use, these are terrible. I did my due diligence and am hoping to save someone else with similar needs the loss of precious funds...\n",
      "My wife says that they are very comfortable.  Exactly what to expect from Clarks shoes, except they are sandals.  She want another pair for next summer...\n",
      "Great shoe!  Can wear it casual, or dressy.\n",

      "Love them and have had them before so I know to order the larger size, so they fit as expected 😀<br /><br />They definitely help my posture and I feel the tingly sensation sooner when walking from using more muscles.\n",
      "Puma is the Only Shoe I have ordered from Amazon, that seems to fit the almost right way. Others are too big...<br />Amazon Boots fit just right and seem to be the only Shoe that can be ordered and fits correctly.<br />I don't know what has happened to the American  / European Shoe Industry in the last 10 to 20 years, shoes seem to not be sized correctly anymore.<br />Maybe the only shoes that are sized correctly are Cement now a days.<br />I recommend not buying shoes at all off of Amazon unless you want to become a Buyer for Crossroads or Goodwill.\n",
      "Good buy! This bag's nice... although it's a little smaller than what I expected.\n",
      "A little small but not to bad. Should have just gone up a size\n",
      "Not 5 stars for the product....the sandals were way too big, but not their fault...but 5 stars for their eventual positive customer attitude. Camel came around to fulfilling my request for a full refund, and they did not require me to return the sandals. All ends well, and I would try again with this vendor.\n",
      "I love love love these sooooooo much!\n",
      "Look very nice with jeans and slacks. They're super comfortable and I got loads of compliments on them. I was a bit concerned that the heel might be s little high and uncomfortable, but they feel good, not too high at all. Very nice shoes. I got them in the black suede too. I'm set for Fall!\n",

      "Very fast delivery & I'm happy with the glasses. I am a woman & they are not too masculine. I am still looking for a more feminine pair that are equally dark. These are also not the darkest locs I've ever had, but I like them\n",
      "Love them❤️\n",
      "i love it too very much\n",

      "Very light weight and comfortable to wear.\n",

      "Overall comfortable sandal. Just a little wide. I actually have 3 other colors. They don't have an arch support, but they didn't' make my arches hurt either.\n",
      "Great shoes for a great price.  This is the second pair I've bought of this style.  I wear them without socks & would recommend the same.  These shoes are attention grabbers, as I receive a lot of compliments.\n",
      "Arrived on time. Packaged well. Very satisfied with product.\n",
      "Love the look - was surprised at how narrow these ones fit this time - I always buy 8 1/2 addidas - got 2 different pairs - the others fit perfect (powerblaze running shoe) and these will stretch but I they were tight and left my feet sore after day 1 - day 2 was better.\n",
      "Cute and decent quality, but runs about a half size small.\n",
      "Got these shoes just before we went out West and put a lot of walking miles on them.  Very comfortable and great value and price.\n",
      "I love these shoes. I originally had the same pair but I lost one while hiking through a creek. They're super comfy. The only negative thing I would say is don't wear them when it rains you will most likely slip and fall .\n",

      "I have very flat feet and would have extreme pain for a day or two after doing TKD.  With these shoes, I immediate felt a huge difference and I know I can do TKD for years now!  Because of the different material on the sole, it has taught me to rotate better on my feet and allows me to be more aggressive with my actions!  This was the best purchase I ever could have dreamed of for TKD.<br /><br />If you have arch problems or pain, buy these shoes, you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Wish I knew about this things back in the day. Been using for the past few months now and even after extensive use of some of my cleats and indoor soccer shoes, they smell as new as they were on the first day. Just put in there after done playing and leave there until next time.\n",
      "look beautiful ..I'm very happy\n",
      "Really Like The Shoes..\n",
      "In love! These fit like a glove, are light weight and super comfortable.  First time I wore these shoes was a day of walking and standing at a sporting event.  My feet felt great.  Looking forward to wearing them to Disneyland! Great buy!\n",
      "I haven't worn Contemporas for years, but I thought I'd try a pair when I saw the price. Unfortunately, they run a little narrower than I remember and I had to send the C width shoes back.<br /><br />Some sizing feedback for those who don't live a dancewear store stocking this shoe in your size: the shoe length was true to sizing guidelines (subtract 2.5 from your street shoe size) - I wear a women's 11 and size 8.5 pointes were the correct length. If you wear a medium width but larger shoe size, I would recommend trying the D width instead of the C width.\n",
      "my cousin love it...\n",
      "Glasses arrived broken. And on top of this, they are very large, more so than you'd think from looking at the picture. I also have my doubts about them being polarized.\n",
      "I give this product a ten on comfort and a three on style.  I have arthritis and fibromyalgia so walking can be extremely painful.  After tearfully saying goodbye to my high heals these were recommended to me by several people. They feel like walking on air. They are the only shoes that do not bother my hip and knee pain, but actually help it.  Now the down side is they are not exactly stylish or cute.  I feel like an old lady in these.  I wish they would make some other more up to date stylish options with the same comfort level.  I have bought the boat shoes they make with the yoga material inside, and while not uncomfortable these go walk shoes are way more comfortable.\n",
      "I gave three stars because even though they pook great the size isnt the same as your usual shoes. And they didn't mention this. If you buy it get a pair 0.5 size higher than usual.\n",
      "I select my size very carefully, still it was quite small. My foot could not fit, if it did it was forcefully. I was very upset upon buying something from amazon to wear and it was horrible size wise. Disappointed.\n",

      "Usually ordered the pro grid but tried these and regret it. The others are better. Got blisters and my leg hurt a lot after walking half an hour.\n",
      "Very comfortable for a few hours, apparently not good to walk in them all day with a short break in period as I did get a blister on my toe and soreness on the outside of my feet near the back strap where the support is either a bit high or not wide enough for my foot. Hoping they will become more comfortable as I wear them more often for shorter periods of time. Normally wear a size 6.5, went with a 7 - the straps are made of a soft material and are very comfortable -  not too loose for being a half size bigger as they are adjustable.\n",
      "Boots are amazing, they fit perfectly and feel great with the extra padding provided with order.\n",

      "It's my fault, I should have ordered a 13.  They are too narrow, too small and I normally 11.5 and figured the 12 would be nice.  If you wear anything above a 10.... just get the 13.  They are constructed really well and I did manage to wear them for a few hours while in Ecuador as inside shoes.  But I left them there with a friend who wears size 10 and they fit him perfect.<br /><br />If they had fit like they were supposed to, I would have loved them.  I would have returned them too, but they were a last minute item for my trip and then I left them behind as a gift.\n",
      "I loved the feel, look, and color of these shoes, but I had to send them back. Im waiting for a larger size to arrive. I ordered a 1/2 size down after reading the reviews....but I couldn't even get them on! I ordered a 1/2 size larger this time, and am hoping they fit!!! Update: the second pair arrived,..and one shoe felt 1/2 size tighter than the other. ...but I kept them. Sadly after paying $46 here, I saw them at TjMax for $29\n",

      "Great shoes.  I like them on runs, walks, etc.  They get a bit dirty since they're all black, but I would buy them again.  I'm 170 pounds and I like to run/walk 3-5 miles a day about 3-5 days a week.\n",

      "After reading some of the reviews I was a little concerned about ordering these shoes but the 7.5N fit perfectly. I wear them three or four times a week for about 12 hours at a time. I have no issues and feel they look great! I have a difficult time finding narrow shoes. These fit and I am getting many compliments on them.\n",

      "Great convenient reading glasses. I have these things taped on the back of my iPhone 6+ and find it extremely useful in situations where I need a quick assist with reading restaurant menus or just a quick read of somethings. My friends liked it so much, now I've ordered 5 more for them.\n",

      "Newton makes very good shoes for someone looking to improve their running form by making you strike on the midfoot.  I've been running in them for about 3 weeks, and still feel soreness in my calves, but I can also feel those muscles strengthening, and I notice a change in my stride when I run in other shoes as well.  The shoes themselves don't make you faster, but they help you to become a better runner.  I have the Gravity and the Distance.  Ironically, the Gravity is designed for longer distances than the Distance (poor name choice IMO).  The Gravity is a little heavier and made of more cushioned, durable material than the Distance.  I like both.  I'll probably wear the Gravity in an upcoming marathon and use the Distance for track running and 5-10K runs.\n",

      "Great fit easy on the toes\n",
      "So far after taking them out on an arduous 10 mile hike, I would say these boots will hold up quite well and last for the long haul. Now this Is preliminary and if time dictates that the quality is not as perceived I will amend my review accordingly. I am looking forward to testing out how well they hold out water and how comfortable they'll be on ever longer hikes but for a short but hard trek, they did the job and handled the varying terrain (mostly rocky) quite well. I am pleased with this purchase and I would recommend these to other hikers or outdoor enthusiasts.\n",
      "Most comfortable shoes ever. I get asked about them all the time.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Very well\n",
      "I had a pair before these ones & they were much better. I don't car for them, they are comfortable for easy & short word periods but I'm a waitress & work long, hard hours & they can't keep up..\n",
      "Nice shoes wore these for 2 days and I have received so many complainants on these. The Royal blue is better than what I expected and the fit is perfect.\n",
      "I love my shoes thanks\n",
      "I love these shoes.  I normally wear a 6.5 or 7, ordered a 7, but they were too small.  Exchanged them for a 7.5 and they are perfect.  They have been my summer go to shoe.  They are comfortable and I have tossed them in the washer a number of times and they still look great.  Wish I could afford to have a pair in every color.  The exchange process with Amazon was extremely easy.  No complaints.\n",
      "They are costume boots. What does this mean? Not much in way of support and the exterior around the ankle collapses just like the image. Also, the zippers are touchy, so no being rough with them. For the price, they are exactly what you would expect. I plan on wearing these for a number of outings, not just once, and they will handle that just fine. I've used other Funtasma boots and they are still going strong after dozens of uses and miles of walking. I put in my own supports, so they feel just fine on my feet after a couple hours of wear and really, that is a necessity. If you are looking for inexpensive costume boots, Funtasma is the standard. If you want something better, expect to spend a lot more money.\n",

      "I love the shoe, color and style\n",

      "I have been looking  for a comfortable pair of sandals since my old bass sandals wore out after 20 years. Changing to Taos brand was<br />a leap of faith. I put these on and said &#34;I can't believe I paid this much for a pair of sandals, but if they last they are worth every penny!&#34;<br />So comfortable. I love the support, the soft lining. My only concern is that they are made in China. (Stamped on sandal) Because I am in another industry in which China is a big competitor I am familiar with  the standards and quality control of China being less uniform and consistent, so  I reserve my judgement on their durability. I will check back in a year to comment on how well they hold up. For now, I am wearing them almost everyday. My feet are so happy!\n",
      "Great little boots!\n",
      "Even though I do like these shoes, they are a little heavy. I bought these for my little guy who has very 'chubby' feet. The multiple straps are perfect at securing the shoes to his feet. However, he is learning to walk with shoes and I just feel that these shoes are a little heavy. I worry that that might be an issue with the learning process.\n",

      "Yea these shoes are very small size 11. Is like a 9 1/2 first time i got riped off from useing amazon. I threw them on wore the my faught just now im stuk with closet shoes.\n",

      "Very good looking shoes.  They might be better suited for people with thin feet.  If possible order it in a wider size than you usually wear.\n",
      "[[ASIN:B0128NXBJI Rocks Eyewear - Emerald Yellow - Made in Italy - Men & Women Sunglasses]] I ordered this in yellow for my boyfriend as a gift. It looks great and stylish! He loves how lightweight it is, and how the bright & cool the reflective yellow color is! The quality of both the rim and the lenses are also good. The black rim is flexible all around and has this cool, matte feel to it. We also both think it feels incredible on your face. The UV protection is excellent for the lenses and I don't get a weird glare from the sunlight as you do with some cheaper glasses. Definitely also perfect for a sporty look/style.  To Summarize: -Great value for money. The quality all around is excellent. -The style and fit is excellent. -It's lightweight and flexible. Feels cool to touch and feels great when on your face. -UV protection and visibility through the lenses are awesome -Love the bright reflective color\n",
      "Love these.. but they do have one flaw.. You can not wash them they fall apart quickly once you do.\n",
      "Everything is great! Arrived within 15 days. All things are the same as showed in a picture,just the color i want. Plenty of card slots for my card and enough space for my cash.\n",
      "all good\n",
      "I was tempted to buy a pair of Vans or Chuck's, but after reading the reviews on amazon as well finding out that Mark Bell 'powerlifter' was involved in the design of these Crossfit Lite TR's...I had to give the shoes a try.  Surprisingly the design of the foot-bed has more cushion than I expected for a fairly flat surface shoe.  They use Ortholite insoles so it's not uncomfortable at all, at least for a few hours of use at a time.  These were designed for powerlifting...not Olympic weightlifting, there is a difference.<br /><br />I have fairly flat feet and noticed most arched supported shoes don't help me in staying 'grounded' to the floor when performing squats, deadlifts or even leg presses.  I bought Asics wrestling shoes to get a more flat feel to my stance and they helped when using them on legs days but they still were 'too' flexible for my taste.  Although, I 'm not sure how these will do during calf exercises due to the stiffness of the soles.  Again, don't expect very much arch support...not the intent of these shoes.<br /><br />These Crossfit Lite TR's covers the best of my needs in a powerlifting shoe.  They fit perfectly...<br />*The best 'grounding' feeling of stability and great heel support<br />*The larger toe box was genius, most tennis type shoes tend to be tight for me<br />*Not a very heavy shoe at all, very comfortable\n",
      "nice and comfortable\n",
      "I was very hesitant on buying Chacos because they are pretty expensive. I caught them on a sale so I couldn't pass them up. I bought them bc we are going on a cruise soon, and I wanted a sturdy sandal that I could wear at the ports. I usually can wear anywhere between a 8.5 - 9.5 size shoe, so I ordered a 9 thinking it would be fine. They ended up being a little too big, so I plan on sending them back and getting an 8. The little bit of walking I did around the house just to see how they felt proved to me that Chacos are worth it. Super comfortable. I just wish that they weren't sliding off of my foot! No compaints, but half sizes would be awesome though.\n",
      "So comfortable!!!\n",
      "Good bargain.  Timely delivery.  Quality shoe.\n",
      "Nice looking glasses its a gift for  someone and hope they like it too.\n",
      "Snug to start and broke in nicely.\n",
      "My little girl loves those shoes, of course everyone wears them these days. Because they are cut out more than the boy kind, these don't stay on her feet as good as they should. We decided to buy some other shoes meanwhile so she can grown into those.\n",
      "The design and the quality look excellent. the boat is not so heavy as expected.\n",
      "I love the color and design. It's not my first Dansko pair and I expected some break-in period. This pair was pretty comfortable from the get go, except for the top of the shoe still is tight on my foot (the part that goes right over the highest point of the foot rise (thus is 4 stars).\n",
      "these shoes are great i ordered a second pair for a friend\n",
      "Perfect fit as I expected. Good quality shoe.\n",
      "they are a little smaller than expected for width.  I would order a size larger next time.  Very comfortable\n",
      "These shoes are super cute and much safer than cheap child flip flops. My daughter has worn them almost every day this past summer.  I love the Croc material as it is durable and comfortable to wear. My daughter did get an odd blister on her big toe from it rubbing, but she also walks more on her toes so I think she was putting too much pressure in that one location.\n",
      "I don't ever write reviews normally.  But I was hesitant to buy this online because I like to try my shoes on before I buy them.  Well if your looking at this boot online chances are you either heard about it being great or bought it for yourself and found out.  Instantly comfortable, very durable and exacting fit.  I wear a 13 EE and usually the chances of me finding that at a retail store are slim to zero.  These fit even better then the ones I bought at a sporting goods store several years ago.<br /><br />If your are thinking about buying a great set of boots online I highly suggest you check these guys out.  Great service fast shipping A+++. Thanks\n",
      "my 8th pair\n",
      "Good price for a good shoe.  It was 50% off!\n",
      "I love these! I bought them for myself (female adult) because I thought they were cool and if I fits, I wear its. They are comfortable but a little high cut because it's right on the edge of my ankle bone and over my Achilles so it's rubbing and bending when I walk, causing blisters. I'm hoping that'll go away once I've worn them out.<br />Love that they light up in the dark so my friends can find me when we're out :)\n",
      "very uncomfortable\n",
      "Just as advertised, great service\n",
      "Freakin cool!! I love it :p\n",
      "I adore these boots. They're the only thing my daughter wore for the first year of her life. They stay on her feet, while looking completely adorable. Totally worth the $!\n",
      "I just received these shoes so I have no idea how well they will hold up but for now they are my favorite walking shoes. Extremely comfortable, easy slip on and off, these are my go to shoes for everything but work. Very light, the cushioned inside is awesome. I walked a trail in these bad boys and despite the rocks, roots, and sticks, I hardly felt anything but cushion. I really hope they last a while.\n",
      "Awesome shoes! So comfortable & no blisters, they wear & wore nicely all day at school ;-)\n",
      "The shoes were just a tad snug at the big toe and the color is more silver than expected. overall a nice looking & feeling shoe.\n",
      "I have terrible neuropathy from back surgery that affects my legs and feet terribly.  We went on holiday recently and I was terrified that I would be in terrible pain and would be unable to do all the walking our holiday would require.  Plus, they are pretty.  These were a God-send for me.  For days and days these sandals kept my feet walking and nearly pain free.  Now I need to find something to wear for the winter months.  Thanks Aetrex!\n",
      "Pretty flats,  a little stiff out of the box but awesome otherwise. My kid hates shoes but managed to keep these on for a couple of hours before flinging them under the table at a wedding.\n",
      "I am very pleased with my new coach sunglasses. They are the perfect weight and fit . And best of all they were reasonably priced .\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "I've been wearing some variation of Ecco's Track 6 shoe for over 10 years now - this is my 5th pair - and they have been consistently great shoes. I'm pretty rough on them, so while my older pairs are &#34;cosmetically distressed,&#34; they are otherwise as comfortable and as serviceable as they were they day I got them. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Returned them - they run at least a size small.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Very Comfortable\n",
      "My favorite shoes. Very comfortable, very stylish, and I will definitely be buying more in the future. Expensive price tag is totally worth it. Ive had mine for years and they're still holding up very well\n",
      "Really cute shoes\n",
      "I bought these for my son's 18th birthday and he absolutely loved them.  Very quick service.\n",
      "THEY RAN TOO SMALL. I'VE BEEN BUYING THEM FOR 4 YEARS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHANGED, I'M 62 YEARS OLD SO I KNOW IT'S NOT MY FOOT. I WANT TO EXCHANGE THEM FOR A LARGER SIZE. I WORE THE ONE PAIR TODAY. I LOVE YOUR BOOTS USUALLY. USE THEM FOR WORK AND HIKING.\n",
      "So small that I can't wear them. There is no return information from this seller so I do not recommend this product.\n",
      "Very Bad'''<br />Its quality is very poor'''<br />Let me Very disappointed '''\n",
      "Fit perfect, comfortable for hiking and spending all day on your feet!\n",
      "I like the feel of the bumps inside, kinda massages your feet while wearing and walking in 'em. personally, not for all day wear for me, but that's probably relative to the wearer as most things are.\n",
      "A bit smaller than same size bought before, toe straps somewhat tight also. Working them in\n",
      "Very cute, but large on my 14mo. She's in the 50% for height and weight, so average sized baby, but these won't fit her for awhile.\n",
      "I love Toms and the order was shipped very quickly\n",
      "fit, design and finishing are very good. I gave four stars because I did expected it genuine suede leather.\n",
      "So far so good. Very comfortable, they don't hug your face so a little air can circulate in there. Seem wider than most so would be good on larger faces.\n",
      "perfect!\n",
      "Superb comfort.  Look even better in person.\n",
      "Fits well just as seem very pretty and comfy.I love every thing about this shoe.\n",
      "already returned it\n",
      "Bought because size said 3.1 inch but was only 2 -5/8 inch. Kept because my roommate wanted one and 2 5/8 was ok\n",
      "With too low a heel, they come off very easily. They do have a good non skid sole but tend to fall off unless you pick your foot straight up when moving forward.\n",
      "great\n",
      "I've owned these for a period of almost two years and they look great, which speaks for the quality of the design and materials. However, there are two slight issues that work themselves into one: sole wear and traction in wet/slipper surfaces (hence the 4 stars). There isn't any, even from the start. You'll quickly find yourself ice skating in restrooms, marble floors, and puddles.\n",
      "This bag is more beautiful in person.<br />Sparkles like diamonds under light. Perfect size. Comes with optional shoulder chain or smaller handle chain.<br />Very pleased.\n",
      "Really like it, great style and most comfortable touch.\n",
      "Fit perfect , great quality , really like the style\n",
      "Good quality shoes for my son's High school uniform\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE these shoes.  I bought them for Beach Body's T25 which is a lot of jumping and lateral movements, and they have far exceeded my expectations.  They are a great shoe and this was an excellent price.\n",
      "Super comfy!\n",
      "Great Kate Spade look! Gift for my sister - she loves them!\n",
      "Perfect.\n",
      "When I went to the local shoe stores to figure out my son's shoe size, which is a 14 in the other shoes. I ordered that size. When they arrived, he tried them on and they barely fit.\n",
      "I have owned these in the past and loved them.  They changed the shoes though, I had to buy an entire size larger then the pair I got last year\n",
      "fits perfectly\n",
      "Very nice\n",
      "good\n",
      "These are so cute!  I ordered up 1/2 size like reviews said, however, for my foot, looks like I need a full size up.  So I just returned these and ordered another pair.  Very cute, light and stylish, I can't wait for me new pair!\n",
      "Great, half eye you can stick in your pocket\n",
      "These are the most comfortable cleats I've ever worn!!\n",
      "WONDERFUL FUZZIES\n",
      "Great product for the price! Love the set of threes, because he is always losing them. My husband has a large head and it's sometimes hard to find glasses that fit... These are perfect\n",
      "I ordered the green, pink & black in size 8. The green & pink fit fine but the black was easily 1 size too large. Seems the black run larger so be mindful if you order the black. The shoes do smell but after awhile the odor goes away. The smell is not as bad as people say. I love the shoes. They are super cute. They are completely flat though, so not the best thing for your feet. I'm going to put shoe insoles in them to give them some arch support.\n",
      "They are cheaply made, I won't wear them outside in the winter as I think my feet will get too cold since these are not made with leather.\n",
      "My only problem with them is that the surface finish of the shoes has started to peel off.\n",
      "Very comfortable and cute!\n",
      "Love it. The perfect size.\n",
      "The ankle strap was tight, the heel strap rubbed a blister\n",
      "These booties were a gift to my daughter.  She loves them!  She is a teacher on her feet all day, and they are very comfortable.\n",
      "Excellent travel bag\n",
      "Looks good with everything. Lightweight makes it especially comfortable and possible to wear all day. Love the height, and because of the platform you don't feel it when you're wearing them.\n",
      "Great look and wonderful price!\n",
      "Love the feel of this shoe, I have used them to walk outside and they are very comfortable.\n",
      "Shoes run large. Had to return them\n",
      "Better than as pictured. Comfortable for long wear. Warm. Versatile style. Order a size up, however. I'm a 10 and needed an 11.\n",
      "Did not like them\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Very comfortable! Love these shoes.\n",
      "The foot fitter worked ok and as expected. The insertion buttons seem to by a kind of plastic rather than a sturdier material like aluminum or something. Other than this it is easy to use.<br />Fast shipping\n",
      "Very cheap looking.  The lighter color on the pair I got looked like it had been painted in.  There were what looked like brush lines and dots/streaks of darker brown throughout the lighter leather.  Very disappointed.\n",
      "it's a great boot, not one complaint.been wearing Wolverine boots now for maybe 10 or more years.\n",
      "They were cheap and not at all what I was expecting. No sparkles and badly made\n",
      "I wear a 12.5, one of the half sizes that is difficult to find.  These fit perfectly and were comfortable from the first day they arrived. I walk on gravel daily at work and needed a trailer runner to avoid tracking rocks into the office. Some shoes claiming to be trail runners will pick up rocks and mud in the tread, these have the proper tread design to avoid picking up debris. They have a little extra support towards the outside of the foot that might not be for everyone, but is what I needed.\n",
      "Comfortable shoes but be aware that a 14 shoe is 49 cm, instead of 48 like some other shoe manufacturers.\n",
      "too large\n",
      "Got this shoe in the off white and they are truly beautiful. Comfortable and classy and the heel height is perfect. well made and good quality leather. Very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "My son loves this slide. It's the only type he will wear and I was happy to find it on Amazon!\n",
      "Beautiful shoe. True to size. Buy it\n",
      "Love these shoes!\n",
      "These shoes are beautiful. The shoes were delivered when they said they would be delivered.\n",
      "I wear an 7.5/8.0<br />I bought these in an 8.5 becuase the other ratings noted a smaller size. They were right. These boots are tight around the toes (actually pretty much just overall to small) and have absolutely no support, making them very uncomfortable.<br />I do like the style of them though, even if the material kinda feels like spray fainted foam.\n",
      "Great product. Fits as expected.\n",
      "Cutest shoes ever with all the bling my granddaughter needs to top off her outfits.\n",
      "Received my Clarks boots in Navy and am trying to decide whether to keep them or not. I wear a 7 and a half and they fit fine<br />with a tall knee sock and my jeans. They come to about 2&#34; below my knee and I 'am 5'2&#34;. I do have room to wear a thicker sock<br />in the winter as the toe box is big enough with out pinching my toes.<br />They look like a rubber winter boot and that is what I don't like. It says they are leather but just don't look like it. I wanted a dress<br />leather navy boot.<br />I will probably keep them because they have a big restocking fee if I send them back, and were very reasonable in price. We have a long winter here in Va, so can use them in the snow.<br />I guess I will try for a more dressy navy leather one and make sure I read the return policy first.\n",
      "I have been a big fan of the Vigor series. I have owned several pairs with no complaints. One of the best trail running shoes you can buy for the money my opinion. I have run multiple 50K races with my Vigors and they have done great. I have tried other trail running shoes that cost well over $100 and have been disappointed. Just remember to order 1/2 size up from your typical size.\n",
      "I love these sunglasses.  They are sturdy and well made but not &#34;heavy&#34;.  Plus they look good!\n",
      "The color is very beautiful, I like it very much!\n",

      "very comfortable\n",
      "The Roxanne Crochet Flats are so comfortable and cute.  They have a rubber sole and are in a crochet type pattern that has a metallic finish to it.  They work perfect for tons of my outfits since I ordered the Natural flats.  I ordered size 7 and I usually wear a size 7.5 and they fit perfect.  I was really worried that they would be tight since 7 is not my usual size but that is not the case at all.  I am really happy with these and I am happy that I received this product at a discount for my unbiased and honest review.\n",
      "I expected the shoes to be wide---Foreign shoes don't use narrow for width.<br />These shoes look great.\n",
      "Pretty great shoes for the price. I can't complain that much. The only thing i would change about these is that I wish that it would envelop my ankle a bit more because it's pretty out there.\n",
      "Cute shoes.  Fit as your would expect a higher heeled shoe - easy to walk in with block heel, though.\n",
      "Great fit, good price! No need to break them in!!\n",
      "Very sharp looking shoe\n",
      "I received a pair of these for Christmas and loved them so I purchased another pair , very good arch support.\n",
      "These are not Non-Slip. I work them to work (a restaurant kitchen with tile floors) and slide all over the place.\n",
      "pretty and comfortable.\n",
      "Thesea are awesome. Purchased for my 6 year old as part of his school uniform. They look stylish but most importantly they are comy enough for recess.\n",
      "Adorable,...great fit. I love these shoes!!!\n",
      "These shoes were for my son for his new job.  He says they are a bit too tight, but hoping that is just because they are new and need to be broken in a little.  Also, he is not use to a job where he has to be on his feet all day.  They do look very good though.\n",
      "I love my Cat face zipper bag coin bag. I have no idea why I got questions pertaining to shoes when this is a coin bag....lol!\n",
      "This design is the the best i ever tried<br />The problem is decreasing availabelity in the market i am afried price will shoot up\n",
      "I usually wear a 10 or 10.5, and, of course, you can't get 10.5.  So I thought that since these shoes had a strap, an 11 would be just fine.  And, they are.  I think they are true to size.  They are VERY wide, though.  Again, since they have a strap, they work for me.  Some might not like the look since they are so wide.  There is a pattern on the inside sole.  My sister tried them on and she couldn't stand that feeling under her foot.  It doesn't bother me.  I've gotten lots of compliments on them--maybe because they are red?\n",
      "did not like the fit of this shoe. I was quite disappointed. maybe i will try another version but this one I did not like\n",
      "Authentic , elegant and classy . I'm very happy with it . It will meet your expectations and more .\n",
      "Item came on time and as expected.  They run small, one size larger than I normally wear fit perfect.  They are good looking shoes and displace water very well.  No complaints thus far.\n",
      "I tried these on at a store before buying to make sure I ordered the correct size. My feet are a size 9.5-10US, so I tried both the UK7 and UK8. The 7s were very snug and would be more difficult to break in, while the 8s were a bit roomy, even with thick socks. I have narrow feet, and the soles are not too loose. I decided on getting mine in a size UK8. Also, they arrived 2 days before the earliest estimated delivery date. Overall I am very pleased, I only wish these were produced in 1/2 sizes.\n",
      "I wear them around the house all day long.  My heel pain is gone.  Love these slippers.\n",
      "This was a pleasant surprise. Shoes are comfortable. I got a size 11 patent black (I'm usually a size 10, but I heeded everyone's warnings.) It's comfortable and the shape of the shoe is fairly flattering.\n",
      "These are great!  I bought for the fall...\n",
      "So much yes.\n",
      "love love love them!\n",
      "very  nice\n",
      "These are too tight in the toe area and I wish to send them back.\n",
      "My daughter loves them. Great school shoes.\n",
      "Love them! Very comfortable.\n",
      "My 6yr old boy loves it.  So far I will definitely say it was a great buy for the price.\n",
      "best &#34;flops&#34; ever.  Love Reef Flip Flops and wish I had a pair of every color.\n",
      "Great shoes!\n",
      "I loved these sandals but the fit felt at least a size off. The fact that the front strap can't be adjusted was the deal breaker for me. I''d have ordered the next size down but none were available. I'd say unless you're on the large end of the size order down one size. Returned them :(\n",
      "its a nice fit.<br />fast shipping!\n",
      "Excelent\n",
      "These boots are great. The color is one of those that goes so well with so much, the style is fantastic and they look great with jeans. My only wish is that they were real leather.\n",
      "Very durable.  I like them a lot.  Good for hiking and stuff.  My wife even lets me wear them in public :)\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Hi, I'm enjoying my comfortable flip flop green sandal. Thank you.\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "My son loves the comfort these bring to his football games.\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "Overall a good looking comfortable shoe.  They just ran a bit big so 1/2 size smaller would have been perfect!\n",
      "These shoes are absolutely excellent. It's the second pair that I've bought on the last two years. The first pair still looks incredible after being used about once or twice a week during the warm months of the year. The soles are very well made, and you can clearly tell the shoe is of high quality. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Beautiful sunglasses looksize exactly like the pictures shown.\n",
      "A lot more comfortable than expected. My only issue, and this is small, is that the bottom of the insert should be more textured. They sometimes slide around when you're putting you shoes on.\n",
      "My second pair.  Love them.\n",
      "love! super comfy\n",
      "Runs small. Need to order a size bigger\n",
      "I was replacing a pair I've had for years and ta-da - the new ones are exactly like the old, finally worn out pair!  Consistency is so satisfying!!\n",
      "Came right on time, I love them!\n",
      "I have no problems with these shoes. Very comfortable.\n",
      "Love these! For the price, they're fantastic and I wear them with everything!\n",
      "i only gave &#34;somewhat small&#34; since they do run small but i had read all the comments for this and bought a 1/2&#34; size larger so that i would fit perfectly. buy a little larger so that you can fit easily.<br /><br />GREAT for weight lifting since it balances you perfectly, BUT not so great for running.\n",
      "Own 2 pair Aetrex shoes  both very comfortable and supportive  probably could wear all day just have not tried\n",
      "Perfect for my daughters first tap shoes, great deal.\n",
      "It not that bad!\n",
      "I loved these babes! They fit true to size!\n",
      "The support in these shoes is good. I ordered the wide and they fit perfect. They're very comfortable on my 5 mile walks. Would definitely recommend. I'm giving 4 stars because they seem slightly flimsy, and I'm not sure how long they'll last.\n",
      "Not made to wear all day\n",
      "Very nice bag, but it's more of a raspberry color (was hoping for more of the bright pink in the picture). Very simple with no logos (other reviews have mentioned a logo) and very chic. It doesn't open very wide so it can be hard to fish into the bag to easily grab items. It's the perfect size for me since I like medium size bags rather than large ones.\n",
      "Very Good\n",
      "Great shoe, but they do run small. Suggest a 1/2 size up from your normal.\n",
      "I love these sandals...best I have ever had\n",
      "Beautiflu!!!!!\n",
      "A great pair of shoes, for my father to buy, he is very fit to wear, but also very comfortable, very good a shopping experience\n",
      "Have had trouble for years finding the right fit due to eee width without spending a lot more than I cared to. These fit like a custom shoe the first time I wore them. Could not recommend them higher for similar shoe needs.\n",
      "Kind of like skinny jeans, many posts mentioned narrow shoe sizes: should have ordered the 2x wide version. Didnt work for me but it could work for you\n",
      "Very pretty but not at all how it appears in the picture. It is not shiny, and the middle bag is flat.\n",
      "This is the way I expected skechers to work.  I love them.  I bought a pair a year ago and they were terrific.  I have 2 jobs that I stand and walk all day, so they are terrific.  I would recommend these to everyone.<br /><br />Thank You\n",
      "Great shoe!\n",
      "This is a good spacious organizer that contains many compartments. I love using it in my handbags that don't have any pockets!\n",
      "Like these shades! But scratched up very fast, within a week...\n",
      "Had to sadly return since the sandals look great but, the heel strap isn't adjustable and didn't keep the sandle on my foot.\n",
      "The size is not right, is bigger than the original one so I had to modify it to make it fit on the frame\n",
      "love the simple boot!\n",
      "I love Havaianas slim flip flops however, not the pattern on these. Kind of dreary. I will return them and select different Havaianas.\n",
      "Cute.  My son loves them!  They don't fit snugly...but I don't expect that kind of fit for crocs.\n",
      "A very little bit small but fits and are comfortable. Wish there were half sizes\n",
      "As advertised. Sealed 5 pairs of Birks with a lot to spare. Gave the rest to a friend to seal hers up.\n",
      "Great running shoes.\n",

      "Way too small. Order a size up.\n",
      "I bought these to look smarter and I like the computer techy look compared to the other set I bought haha. Works a treat- people take me much more seriously, plus when I put them on I know it's business time!\n",
      "Love the IC Berlin glasses. They are so well made and versatile but I have the worst luck with them.  I lost these in Hawaii a few months after buying them, which is I think the 4th pair of IC Berlin Shades I've lost. Theyre too expensive for me to keep buying and leaving places, but if you keep better track of your sunglasses than I do, highly recommended.\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "Very fragile, both pairs I purchased broke with two weeks of wear.\n",
      "strongly recommended for easy-fit and replacement lace.\n",
      "These shoes have been amazing. I work 12 hour shifts and walk between 5-8 miles per shift. These shoes have given my feet a chance to recover from years of were from work boots and working out..<br />I won't go in depth regarding the pros and cons,but I will write this, I've only experienced pros from these shoes thus far.\n",
      "Loved it and the size was just right\n",
      "the straps are snug across the top of the foot the fit and comfort is ok except for that strap. maybe if the velcro and strap was redone the shoe would be more comfortable.\n",
      "love them. so comfortable I wore them all day\n",
      "Son loves them. First day of school.\n",
      "great fit and price! fast shipping....very pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "I'm loving these for my kindergartner.. She doesn't tie her shoes yet and these are great so that while at school her teacher isn't tieing 20 kids shoes. We ordered the bright yellow bv those go with about 3 pairs of her shoes.\n",
      "I love this wallet so much like words can't even explain\n",
      "I have been wearing these boots for almost 2 weeks. I am a journeyman power lineman and I love these boots. To me there was no break in at all. Love that they are waterproof and steel toe eh rated.\n",
      "These shoes are so cheaply made, that I would not EVER want to wear them.\n",
      "disappointing\n",
      "Nice boots.  Affordable.  Quick ship.\n",

      "Very happy with them, great price.\n",
      "Just a little big but not too bad\n",
      "Is the  old design , but is really good the color and the size\n",
      "I love this, it is beautiful. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I thought it was white and it  is actually a cream color. I kept it- still beautiful!!\n",
      "Thanks, the boots for my wife were a great fit. The quality of the material is sturdy.\n",
      "If I live long enough to wear these boots out I will buy another pair just like them\n",
      "A very good buy, comfy and forms to the foot in a short time.\n",
      "This is a functional light weight bag. The ornament doesn't have color like the photo as the faux leather is extremely &#34;faux.&#34;\n",
      "took about a week to break them in, they feel good now.  I have had Georgia boots before, good quality for the $$$.<br />this is the first pair of slip-on's I have owned. so far so good.<br />I am a Machinist working 12 Hr. days.\n",
      "I'm so glad I found this adorable and high quality sandals for my toddler. The same sandals (but in blue color) cost $55 at Geox store and I was ready to buy them at the store. But because the store doesn't have them in my son's size (5,5) I decided to check Amazon and glad I did. Same shoes but just a different color (red is great color as well) and the price is half off. I couldn't be happier! I love GEOX shoes for my baby boy, it was his first walking shoes. I love Pediped as well but compare to Stride Rite this one (Geox) are much MUCH better. The quality stands by itself, and I love the design and the look of the shoes. Highly recommend, especially if you find a great deal like this one.\n",
      "Way too small, order a size up;\n",
      "Love the boots but the soles wear out really fast..\n",
      "very narrow. 5.25&#34; / 133.mm width. too bad because they are cute!\n",
      "I just received these boots today & they are absolutely cute. The calf room is super roomy ,but I have a thick calf so these work for me. I can't wait to wear these in the fall and for the price they deserve 6 stars .\n",
      "Just ordered a second pair. Great shoe, great price.\n",
      "Super super cute I love it !\n",
      "Beautiful boots and came in narrow size which I need.  Since they are a Christmas present from my husband, I can't wear them until after Christmas.  I did try them on and they felt wonderful, so I anticipate that they will be comfortable all day.\n",
      "Cute. Color just as expected<br />Very cocomfortable\n",
      "Love the shoes\n",
      "These are super cute shoes IF only my 7 year old could get them on her feet. The &#34;stretch laces for easy on & off&#34; do NOT stretch to allow us to even get them on her foot. I think they would fit if we could actually get them past her heel. VERY disappointed.\n",
      "Good comfort fit.\n",
      "these are smaller than the small in dept stores, they areva 52 vs a 55.\n",
      "My son loves these\n",

      "Had to return.\n",

      "Love Dansko shoes! Very comfy and offer good support.\n",
      "the best\n",
      "Love these shoes! They are so comfortable! I was looking to replace an old pair.\n",
      "I bought the shoes as new. Don't give me a beat up box someone saved for 10 years, not acceptable. God only knows if they were new or not. If I bought used shoes fine, new not okay.\n",
      "Glasses are amazing. Authentic product, I'm very satisfied!\n",
      "The product is of good quality and description matches well.\n",
      "These shoes are amazingly comfortable!\n",
      "The fit and comfort is great, especially if you have wide feet like I do. However, the shoes are a bit clunky and make it difficult to get a good touch on the ball.\n",
      "these do NOT fit original half jacket frames.\n",
      "Great boot. Delivered a day ahead of scheduled date. The fit is perfect especially when added with a good insole. Only wish could have used more than 1 gift card when ordering and paying.\n",
      "Great fit and good looking boot on!!\n",
      "I absolutely love these shoes. They are extremely high like I thought they would be. They fit perfectly and to size.\n",
      "I really like this product it has enough room for everything I need to carry, when I'm being lazy and don't want to take a purse. I'm getting one in black.\n",
      "Bought to use as a walking sandal, not so much for style. They are comfortable tho.\n",
      "holding up pretty nicely even when wearing often.\n",
      "Love this Flipflops. They fit perfect and look great.\n",
      "Mu husband loves it. He wears it all day at work.\n",
      "Worn these all day a few times since purchasing, very comfortable. They will be a staple for me this fall.<br /><br />Make them in leather and I will be ordering in bulk... just saying! ;-)\n",
      "I have to say I was a little worried about how these would fit. I have purchased shoes online in the past that have not fit as expected. I put these on and right away was very happy. I don't normally wear flats, but think I have a new favorite shoe. I am on my feet all day long at work. I came home from work and as usually kicked off my shoes, slipped these on and was already happy with my purchase. They fit great, look great, feel great. I love how they look with my jeans, and sure they will look just as good with any other outfit. Now all I need is more colors. I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for a honest review.\n",
      "My 2yr old absolutely loves these shoes! She wants to wear them non-stop.  I think she especially likes that she can put them on herself.  We now have them in blue and pink and get compliments on them every time she wears them. I want a pair for myself!\n",
      "I recommend this shoe to anyone that like a comfortable fitting shoe.\n",
      "Great pen case with rapid  delivery.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "The shoes are too wide and fit more like a 7 than the 5 1-2 that they are.  I see no information on returning them for my refund.  How do I go about that ?  There was no paperwork in the box\n",
      "love them.  repeat order'\n",
      "Very nice ballet shoe but it has a very slick black sole unlike the brown pair I have.  It was too dangerous on carpet and tile which is why I has to return it.\n",
      "I had to go buy inserts because crocs were too large. Too expensive considering total cost for shoes & inserts. Next time, I'll buy them in a store so I can try them on.\n",
      "Great shoe with a lot of support and cushioning. The only disappointment was the sole wear.\n",
      "Almost nothing to these shoes--light and airy. The back of the heel slips a bit in mid-step, maybe because I don't lace them all the way to the last eyelet.\n",
      "I ordered these as a gift and they were about a half size too small, so I exchanged them.  The exchange was 100% hassle-free and the new ones were perfect!  Great for all types of use from casual to sport--we intend to use them kayaking for a lightweight pull-on shoe we can get in the water with if need be.\n",
      "This is my second pair of Clark's flip flops, and I love them. Well-made, comfortable, can walk all day in them.\n",
      "I feel satisfied with these shoes, beautiful and comfortable, thanks\n",
      "I've had this style of Mephisto shoe before and LOVED them.  I ordered up a size from my usual size, but they were still a bit too short, and too narrow.  Too bad, I really wanted to keep them!\n",
      "Love Clarks, another great shoe. Do make sure to give these a nice clean every now and then so they last a while.\n",
      "Great shoes!!\n",
      "WOW these shoes were made for instant comfort and style.  I have worn the khaki shoes and washed them over and over all spring and summer and they are still such great shape.  They look almost new even after months of wearing them often.  I have ordered a second pair for fall.  This is a great shoe if you need to look dressy casual.  I am 63 and loving the comfort!\n",
      "Awesome flip flops.  Can't believe how comfortable they are - the thong is soft material and the flips flops are actually lined with material that has yoga poses.  I've never put anything on my feet that were as dreamy as these.  The Yoga Mat top is like a mattress for your feet you can wear them 24/7.  Because I've been bragging about my new flip flops - I now have orders from my family I have to fill!\n",
      "Best sandals i have owned.\n",
      "Cute boot but it's too large. My daughter is out of a size 3 shoe and going into a size 4, I even went to a shoe store to get her foot measured. Oh well.\n",
      "I often have to &#34;break&#34; these shoes in over several weeks. I was able to immediate start wearing them all day long! Nice fit\n",
      "These boots are great. I wear a 11 1/2 wide all the time, So I ordered these the same. Will say they were a little loose but there is not much padding in the shoe, so I ordered a pair of Dr Scholls inserts and the boot fits perfect, and with the inserts is very comfortable. Very happy with the purchase.\n",
      "NICE!!!<br /><br />New Balance Men's ML565 Classic Running...\n",
      "These sandals do run about a full size small. Meaning an 11 is really a 10. Other than that they felt great right out of the box and seem to be built well.\n",
      "The boot itself is very comfortable, and thats even without the boot liner socks. To me the boot is a little too high but I bought the boot anyway, because I got tired of waiting for the price to go down.\n",
      "A little too tight  Maybe when I break them in\n",
      "A gift to my sister and she loves it as it's very comfortable!\n",
      "True to size. Daughter says it feels good to her feet. Just wish I had order a size bigger to make shoe last longer.\n",
      "My husband ordered these and LOVES them. He had purchased them and then gave them to a family member that liked them. Then he regretted it and missed them. So he bought this pair. He loves the shoes and I ended up buying a pair in the women's. They are a sturdy shoes but not heavy. Great for hiking but I wear them everywhere.\n",
      "For decades Adidas have set the bar on cool. They look great, feel great, are great. From the courts to the comfort of any other surface, Adidas has got you covered. These shoes are no different. Superstar's are the business. The shell toe is highly fashionable and the rest speaks for itself. I opened the box and smiled. I already knew what to expect. I was just grinning because I got them at such a crazy price. Like around $31 with the discount. I couldn't believe it. Shell toes for that price? Wish I could've gotten more.\n",
      "very nice\n",
      "Wish there were more\n",
      "Great fit. Comfortable and Water resistant. Marvelous shoes\n",

      "The size is a little tight, as other reviews suggest, but they are nice and comfortable if you get one that fits, You may need to go up a size in order to do this.\n",
      "Love Vera Bradley bags. A well constructed bag. However it is a little larger than I like. It does have lots of room for everything. I really appreciate the outter carpartment to hold my tablet. I wish it had another pocket on the other side to put papers.\n",
      "They run large - i wear a 7 - very glad i went with a 6....they fit perfectly.  And - good arch support which is why i bought them.  And - they aren't hideous.\n",
      "My son is very happy with his new cleats.  Very comfortable.\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "This is a cool bag. It's definitely orange not brown. The leather feels nice though. I hang my bags from the loop at the top and this one came apart after a week. I still love the bag and the store owner was quick to resolve the issue.\n",
      "These are my second pair of ASICS and I love everything them.\n",

      "Not Revo\n",
      "they run small ordered 1/2 size bigger. run narrow cramp up after wearing awhile. hope they will break in? if not out $$$$$\n",
      "i wish more american companies were as consistently dependable as german.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Brown color is darker than picture shows (still nice shade though)... Comfy flip flop. (much more comfortable than Soda brand flip flops!! (If you're browsing/comparing). I hv narrow feet - this flip flop was not snug but not loose either; a good balance. The top part and the toe part are pretty soft... Fits true to size. Enjoy! ^_^\n",
      "Stylish and comfortable for rainy day wear, just what I was looking for!\n",
      "I found these shoes to be the perfect gift for male friends.\n",
      "Awesome!!\n",
      "These are nice, comfy and the colors are vibrant. They also are better than I expected around water, traction is pretty good.\n",
      "Super comphy!\n",
      "While I didn't mind the looks of this shoe, the fit was way off. I got a 9 wide and the toes were fine but the heel was way too loose and the top of the instep was too tight. I'd have to say it was too big AND too small. Very strange. Had to pay return shipping and a restocking fee.\n",
      "I ordered two pair.  Typically, I cannot wear this type of sandal I get a blister or sore between the toes.  This sandal I have walked 3 or more miles in around town on a brisk walk, very comfortable, durable, and soft.  I have scrapped them with our damage and walked in the rain without damage to them.  They fit perfectly and look good on the feet.\n",

      "Love this bag!!! So much room!!!! Carrying today...getting a lot of compliments!!!\n",
      "Review questions were about shoes, not a tote.  Didn't  make sense.<br />However, loved the tote but for my use, I exchanged it for a smaller one.  It is sturdy, stands on its own.  There is such a wide variety of sizes and designs.\n",
      "The 6 year old is a big fan.\n",
      "I was looking for walking shoes that are slip-on and these serve the purpose, we are not allowed to wear tennis shoes to work but I go for a 30 minutes walk after lunch every day and I don't want to carry an extra pair of shoes. The description says they are white but they are not, the color of the picture is true. I still want a white pair so I just bought a pair of Sketchers from Amazon, I will write a review on these once I receive and try  to walk in them.\n",
      "Love these boots!! Perfect\n",
      "Awesome shoes ! Had a lot more grey than in the picture !!! But other than that 5stars !\n",
      "Now I know why my son only wears Merrell shoes!!  Just sorry I waited so long to join him.  Seriously, these were comfortable from the moment I removed them from their box!  They may be my first Merrell's but I doubt they will be my last!\n",
      "Ok first they came super quick only like 2 weeks. Heel height is exactly as expected perfect suede. Absolutely in lovee gonna wear them tonight\n",
      "This bag does not accord with the picture, not really leather.\n",
      "my daughter has wide feet and it is sometimes difficult to find shoes that have straps to fit. She was able to wear these shoes for 6 months because of the flexibility of the strap. I try to always buy stride rite for my kids due to the high quality. My daughter was able to wear her shoes to day care and they were still nice enough after 6 months of wear and tear to pass on to a friend.\n",
      "Besides being a bit tight, they're well made. I almost sent them back, but for the price, I figured the few hours here and there I'll wear them, they'll be fine.\n",
      "Good product and blue is hard to find.\n",
      "I'm liking the shoe very much, but can already tell that they wont last to long, Also I can't wear them for to long.\n",
      "over priced for the quality\n",
      "Comfortable shoes but the height is alittle higher than I expected.\n",
      "Very big shoes unfortunately.\n",
      "this bag is hella cute the only issue i had with it was that 2 tassles fell off within the first day of me having it.  it doesn't look ridiculous without them but still that was kind of unexpected. still--bag is cute, affordable, and VEGAN.\n",
      "These hiking shoes were awesome...bought them 1 month before 55+ mile back country hiking trip in Yellowstone.  Very little break-in required.  No blisters or hot spots at all  - performed flawlessly - great grip and not clunky like other hiking shoes.  Recommend getting gaiters with low tops if in muddy conditions.\n",
      "Best shoes I've ever owned\n",
      "I've had my eye on this purse for a long time. It was worth the wait.  It's nice and big, room for all my things and it was shipped in a timely manner.  It's completely authentic and the price was great.\n",
      "I find it difficult to get shoes wide enough for me.  I am happy with these.\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "These are my favorite heels, I have 7 pairs of them in every color I can get!\n",
      "love them. The white stripe adds alittle modernity to what are rather convention shoes ;)\n",
      "heal funny shape  large not style I expected, returned. Nothing wrong with product.\n",
      "I really like this shoe, but it is not comfortable. I will have to send it back. Thank you so much!\n",
      "Didn't like I don't think it looks like the picture at all.\n",
      "SHOP FOR MY FAMILY MEMBER~\n",
      "Very comfortable right out of the box. Very light weight.\n",
      "Beautiful shoes better than I expected\n",
      "l LOVE these shoes. so much so I'm about to buy another pair so I have them for next year.  I wear them ALL the time and am wearing them OUT!!  I have arthritis in my ankle and these shoes give me great support.  I can walk all day with these shoes on - wore them to Hershey park a couple of weeks ago and they were sooooo comfortable.  this is coming from someone who after 2 hrs of walking I limp if I don't have the right shoes on.  please keep making and selling these!!!!\n",
      "Great sunglasses.  They look amazing.  It has a bigger lens so it looks good if your face is a bit wider.\n",
      "I am disappointed.  Buxton has a reputation for high quality, and I owned my last Heiress wallet for nearly 20 months before buying this one.  Gosh what a difference!  This one just isn't what I expected...cheap thin leather, bad stitching of the zipper to the leather that's already coming out, cheap plastic backing (instead of leather) on the checkbook cover that won't allow its removal from the wallet...the only good thing I can say is that I didn't have to pay full price.  I've been a loyal Buxton customer for nearly 30 years.  If this is what Buxton has sunk to, I may not be back.\n",
      "I have a wide foot.  The fact that they were wider when I first tried them on was not an issue.  I have purchased many pairs of Clarks shoes in the past and will continue to do so!\n",
      "I love the color\n",
      "Just as expected, fit, color, service\n",
      "These vans look great and are also great for skating\n",
      "I love these sandals, the only thing I dont like is they get very sticky on your feet if its hot.\n",
      "Love these boots but they are not the pretty blue color shown.  They are grey! Which was fine with me.\n",
      "wristlet broke after 2 days\n",
      "BEST SHOES EVER and I'm back to get another pair! I have dead to the floor flat feet and got PF in only one foot (go figure). However the PF is now nearly done after several months of wearing these. I've even gotten to the point where I will get up and walk around without them because the pain is sooo relieved. If you have PF, esp newly diagnosed you won't go  wrong with these. I'd had it for a little while - couple of months-- and upon putting these on and taking a step, I was floored I could walk normally again. I almost had to learn to re-walk since I had been limping. PF usually needs a multi treatment approach, but these should be on your list.\n",
      "One of the best cycling glasses I've had so far. And what you get for the price is the best part of it all. Great packaging and fist class group.\n",
      "Very comfortable and they have a wide toe box.\n",
      "I wore a hole in the sole of my first pair, I'm working on the second and purchasing a third!  I cannot live without these shoes!\n",
      "It's a great product.  Does work as expected. I just wish there was a way to put the added plastic pieces further up toward the front of the stretcher, more toward he tip of the shoe.\n",
      "I have owned them for less than a month but they seem to be well made and comfortable to wear. the sun protection is excellent  and the colors are very vivid and at the same time restful on my eyes\n",
      "great glasses for the price\n",
      "The silver coating on the frame pulled off in big flakes just removing the sticky tag on the side.  These are really REALLY cheap sunglasses.  I have seen better in the 5 buck range at grocery stores.\n",
      "spacious and functionable\n",
      "My daughter is the envy of all her classmates. They're better than I expected.\n"

      "This are a lot different than the Billfish boat Lite weight shoe. This shoes sole actually lasts.\n",
      "Took two weeks to receive.  Tried them on, and I could feel the red bands that wrap around the arch of the shoe, just standing.  Walked a few steps, and could feel them then, too.  These are neat looking, the mesh is good on them.  But they won't work for Zumba, or for me, just wearing them.  Size fit was perfect.<br />Requested a refund.  If there's a problem with that, I will update.\n",
      "10's are slightly too big, and 9's are slightly too small. I really wish they would have had 9.5.\n",
      "These were fun for my son, but he outgrew them quickly and was rarely able to wear them. They were sturdy and can be worn with or without the wheels, which came in handy.\n",
      "Not worth it\n",
      "It works great and it looks good.\n",
      "We had to exchange for a larger size.\n",

      "I have worn them walking and shopping all day and my feet never have gotten tired.  Great product.\n",
      "This was supposed to be a great deal and the original show fit me like a champ.  The problem is that I was sent a size 6 in mens and not the 9.5 I had ordered.  It is a great shoe and super sticky, with a long climbing life... Problem is that it never got used.\n",
      "Have to return, TOO narrow!\n",
      "These a bit snug to my feet for 14s.  the narrow towards the toe and I prefer a wide toe box, so had to send them back.\n",

      "These are great boots. I used my own orthotics for better support.\n",
      "Super comfy love them 😍😍😍😍\n",
      "They are ok\n",
      "By far the best shoe I've ever worn! Go 1/2 size up. Provides comfort all day. I'm on my feet for 14 hours a day as a nurse, because we all know 12s don't really exist. You won't be sorry if you buy these!!\n",
      "i have not gotten to wear it yet but when i tried it on it felt comfortable and it worked with the dress. i love that i can use a bra that i already have for this because it saves me money and time shopping for the right undergarment.\n",
      "I think the other review was unfair.  It's clearly listed as a mini satchel and so is SMALLER than your standard dome purse.  I bought it for a friend as a birthday present and she thought it was adorable and uses it primarily for evening.  The leather quality is good and the colors are fun.  I'm considering buying one for myself.  It's a cute bag for casual evening events or when you want to carry a little bit more than a wristlet or clutch would hold.\n",
      "Perfect shoe for the beach not too expensive and did a wonderful job will wear them around the house in the pool highly recommend to anyone looking for a water shoe\n",
      "100% quality!\n",
      "I love Keen's!  These are great, and have a dual purpose.  I use them as water shoes also.\n",
      "The threads on the sides of the shoe are kind of visible which makes me think they are not great quality. As for the size, I am a size 8 usually and that's what I ordered and they fit fine on the width but it is a little snug on the length. I will keep you updated on how long they last.  So after using this product for once a week, for almost 9 months, inside a store (do note that this is not much wear compared to my KEDS which I wear everyday in rain) it already has multiple holes, such a waste of money. I suggest you invest in a good quality sneaker.\n",
      "This is not authentic this purse is a fake don't like wont ever order again disappointed extremely\n",
      "These are awesome! Purchased them for my daughter for school and now they are her go to shoe. She says they are super flexible and comfortable. The price was also great. We would purchase again, in fact I think we may get a second pair.\n",

      "Once you get past the dreaded &#34;break-in&#34; of Rainbows, you will never wear any other shoe again. I live in Hawaii and I've worn these every day for a year and they are in EXCELLENT shape. I love love love my rainbows\n",
      "Cute shoes but they run at least two sizes small. I wear a 9 1/2.  Ordered a 10 and gave them to a friend who wears a 9.  She likes them.\n",
      "Great shoes for working on concrete floors, I would recommend them for that type of work.\n",

      "Great all round shoes\n",
      "It is hard to get the cards out.  Money is a pain to get in and out of.  Looks cool but is annoying and I bought another one finally to replace it.  Probably good for kids.\n",
      "&#34;Slim&#34; cut style really flatters the foot. Hugs the arch nicely for a pretty point unlike other more bulky shoes. They do run a bit small and because the canvas is lighter weight, they wear out faster.  A thicker leather sole would help turning but it's adequate.\n",
      "wore these on a trip to the zoo.  very comfortable.  I didn't experience my usual low back pain from walking all day.\n",
      "These are heavier than any boots I've ever owned, and they're not even boots. But the arch support is good and they are comfortable. I wear a 10.5 and went up to an 11; they go on easily and the liner prevents discomfort from rubbing. These are good for my purpose, which is to walk my dog in wet fields in the morning. Maybe the heavy weight will help build up my legs.\n",

      "I grew up in the city of San Clemente, California, where the Rainbow sandals are made! I have worn them since they opened their doors! There is no other sandals made better and with pride! However I do know they have sourced them out which has been very upsetting to me personally but I do encourage you to own at least three pairs you will not be sorry and as for colors they have them all!\n",
      "I was worried these wouldn't be stylish enough to wear every day.  They are so very comfortable.  I love them.\n",

      "The only reason I bought these is so I can touch the ground on my FJR when I stop. Cheap fix for short legs on a tall motorcycle. They fit fine .<br />Larry\n",
      "I loved these shoes when I got them, cute, comfortable and they fit well. I wore them 2 - 3 times a week. Now I've had them 3 months and the gold color is flaking off all over the top and sides. Definitely NOT the kind of quality product that I expect when I buy Sketchers\n",
      "My feet were so painful I had to walk with a cane. I wore these shoes 4 days and was much improved. I could walk without pain.\n",

      "very good\n",
      "Love them...excellent price and true to size\n",
      "The boots are cute however they wear too easily.  I bought two pairs and each of them the fabric is already wearing off.  I think these would are more of a fashion type of boot...for show only.\n",
      "1. Looks good<br />2. Comfortable<br />3. Offers about as much protection as my expensive polarized Ray Bans and the Oakley's used for almost a month before returning (can't really tell much difference)<br />I certainly highly recommend these.\n",
      "These are for my Great Granddaughter and she loves them.  She's only 4 years old and this is the best I can tell you.  Thank you\n",
      "These are very stylish for those who have a small head and nose bridge.  I struggle to find sunglasses that fit me and don't make me look bug eyed.  I'm very happy with these.\n",
      "Great for the beach or outdoors.\n",
      "Despite my first size choice being a bit small (I'm literally a 7 3/4, and I never know on what size a shoe is going to fall, and the wrap was comfortable (if slightly snug) at the 7.5 size, but I couldn't fit the &#34;flats&#34; part of the shoe on with the wrap on.  I think the 8's will be perfect!<br />Great for anyone doing yoga, or any usually barefoot dance or exercise that requires a bit more grip.  Could also see the wrap as good beam/floor shoes.\n",
      "Great!!!\n",
      "beautiful mules.  I am accustomed to Frye fitting large so ordered a 7.5 to fit my 8.5 feet.  turned out they are pretty much true to size...maybe just a touch large.\n",
      "The size is too small than other models of polo shoes\n",
      "Great!!!!!!!  Very Comfortable and the fit is excellent!\n",
      "Excellent sneakers and great price.\n",
      "I love these shoes!  They are cute and comfortable.  They are also stable with a non-slip rubber textured sole and a nice wide heel.\n",
      "I have had my purse since Aug 12 and I noticed the strap on one side has come in sewed AND its about to break from the gold piece that holds it together! Very disappointed with it ..still love the purse its just broke ALREADY! Refund!?!???\n",
      "Small and narrow although I ordered a larger size. Insoles would not fit.  Sides of the shoe are too soft;  Pretty show though.\n",
      "Excellent! beautiful\n",
      "Too small. I have 4 pairs of shoes and all of them are 8.5 in size. I ordered a 8.5 thinking it would be nice and it was way too small I am waiting for a refund.\n",
      "Glasses are exactly what I wanted  and very flexible as advertised\n",
      "I use arch support insert. This is third pair of these for me. Please keep making them.\n",
      "Very attractive boot, not too heavy which is a pet-peeve of mine. I am a size 9 to 9.5 and ordered a 10 based on the reviews and because half-sizes are not offered. The 10 is too big (heel goes up and down). But with thick socks it does not rub in a painful way. It has not yet rained here so cant comment on effectiveness. I am 5'8 with skinny calves and the boot does come up to about lower to mid-calf on me and does rub slightly. It is a little annoying but if I werent concentrating on the boots I probably wouldnt notice it.\n",
      "Look great. Arrived quickly.\n",
      "Love these shoes. Everything I was looking for. I liked them so much I bought another pair in a different color.\n",
      "My mom loves these. They are the only sandals that don't hurt her feet. She needs good arch support.\n",
      "I absolutely love this bag! I bought it to wear classes at University and it is perfect. It has much more room than i thought it did and it can hold all of my books and stationary. Lovely purchase!\n",
      "It's just what I wanted except the coin section is pretty hard to get into to get coins out.\n",
      "Love, love, love this bag!\n",
      "I like them, but they aren't the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. The style is awesome, though. Just what I was looking for. Discomfort? - a small price to pay for the fashion.\n",
      "Love love love this purse. Got it quick and rarely ever do I switch to a different one. Lots of storage I even use outside gun pocket for my cell phone. This seller was awesome\n",
      "So far so good... Customer service...fantastic\n",
      "I ware size 9 - so I ordered size 9 1/2 thing they would to small - the opposite happen they were to large - I ordered 2 pairs of size 9 and I love these shoes - very comfortable - true to size - and I might order a third pair\n",
      "Bought them 5 years ago, and still using.They are still in great shape.<br />I do not think I will every buy anything other than crocs as slippers. They are very very very comfortable.\n",
      "The glasses where dark enough and covered my eyes. And they came with a bag so that was nice.\n",
      "My 2nd pair of Maui Jim, and it's just as I expected. The clarity of the lenses is second to none, very light weight frame meaning no mark on either side of the bridge of the nose. The arms are not too loose or too tight right out of the box and most importantly, the fit is perfect!<br /><br />I have a small noggin which often gives me difficulty finding sunglasses that fit nicely. Women's sunglasses tend to be a bit small with short arms and men's tend to be too big. I found a happy medium when I switched to Maui Jims a year ago. I have the Maui Jim Waterways which I love but decided to invest in another pair this time opting for one with nonslip silicone nose pads. I researched for about two weeks before finally deciding to pull the trigger on these Kawikas and man they are exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about getting a pair of Maui Jims, I would highly suggest you just man up and get em. I know that the price is a bit high, but trust me, they are worth it. Aside from the excellent quality, Maui Jim has a great selection to choose from.\n",
      "They run small - because of the waterproof gore-tex lining - so I go up 1/2 size ... and have no problem.<br />I have a wide foot - I was wearing a size 9 1/2 4E in New Balance shoes - but since I have switched to Asics I went up a full size to a 10 1/2 in order to have enough width and I go up another 1/2 size when I buy the gore-tex lining.  They do not rub my heel - and are only slightly longer in the toe area.  I love them !!<br />First of all Asics are wonderful - I walk 5 miles a day/5 days a week.  Next - G-TX is wonderful !!!  .... I work in delivery during summer rain - and winter snow ..... these shoes keep you feet warm in the winter and DRY .... and they are not too hot for summer either.  The only reason I haven't purchased them to wear year round was the price .... .but my other Asics have greatly increased in price, making these about the same price - so I may start buying the G-TX year round. .... they are just harder to find to purchase.<br />They have changed the style since 2014 and this style was a little stiffer - took a little time at home to break them in.  First pair of Asics ever that I had to have break-in time.\n",
      "awesome love them\n",
      "Boots are as described, they wear very comfortable, easy to put on, appear to be well made.\n",

      "Super comfortable and lightweight.\n",
      "My daughter loves these shoes. Beautiful bubblegum pink color. Fits like a glove\n",
      "Three little girls are loving them! Great for walking, playing on playground (with heel strap on).\n",
      "These shoes do not have the arch support that the others I have purchased.\n",
      "I think these will fit perfectly after wearing them a few times. Like them!\n",
      "Very good product, Thank you\n",
      "Arrived as expected . Nice sharp looking shoe .\n",
      "I have several pairs on Vionic sandals. These were too large/too wide for a size 9. A friend who wears a size 11 was able to fit into these shoes. Use caution when purchasing.\n",
      "These run a size too big, had to return them and the smaller size was unavailable, very disappointing for someone with a size 15 foot!!!\n",
      "Really like these shoes first time buying and trying FitFlop shoes and I'm glad I did very well made and pretty I'm normally a 9.5 or 10 in size medium width and after reading helpful reviews for sizing I decided to go with a 9 because it was open toed and foot bed length is good. They stay on your feet effortlessly and are really cushioned and comfortable to walk and stand in. I will defintely buy another pair and style very well made don't get frustrated with sizing once you get the size down their a dream to walk in.\n",
      "Beautiful shoe but I wouldn't recommend if u have small calf's..the straps will not fit snug to your legs\n",
      "This was a gift for my daughter. She loves them and wears them all the time. They were less expensive than anywhere and fast shipping. Thank you!\n",
      "beautiful shoes!! ordered a size bigger, like suggested in reviews, love the color, the sparkle and they look great, comfortable.\n",
      "Good heel height for comfortable walking and standing. Broad enough toe box to prevent adverse pressure.\n",
      "Nice looking comfortable shoes! Will definitely buy them again.\n",
      "They are comfortable, I did have a problem, as soon as I worde them the first time one of the straps came out of the silver buckle and I have not been able to put it back in. other than that I like them\n",
      "Great fit as expected\n",
      "Awesome product.<br /><br />I guess it is true that you do not realize a good thing until it is gone.  I am writing this after trying the new Kahana7, which is a disappointment.<br /><br />This shoe feels extremely comfortable.  I have ran in this shoe on trails, tracks, roads and everything in between.  I average about 40miles a week and I believe this shoe has helped me avoid injury.  I love the way it support the heals and ankles.  Please bring this model back asap!!!!!!\n",
      "They are quite comfortable, I would be in them all day buy not bad for several hours. And they are soft on the soles of the feet.\n",
      "I totally love this produce .. saw great results I only two weeks...\n",
      "Nicely made classic Aviators available in several colors. I have this in the Grey frame/Blue lens, and I like it a lot. My better half, who does not usually like Aviators, likes this pair a lot.<br /><br />The blue lens has a reflective mirror quality, a bit more than the Amazon photo indicated. I don't mind it, but it's sort of a California Highway Patrol look, so don't be surprised.<br /><br />Aviators usually have pretty fragile metal frames, and these are no exception. They come with a soft microfiber bag, but no hard case, so if you'll be packing these in a travel bag you'll want some kind of hard case for them.<br /><br />Lightweight. Comfortable to wear. Good visibility through the lenses. They feel good and look good.<br /><br />Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review. These are the only Aviators I own that my Better Half actually likes the looks of. I'm pleased with them.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful as you comparison shop online. Happy shopping, everybody.\n",
      "As other posters mentioned, the shoe runs small. I have NEVER ordered a size 9 shoe, yet I had to return these and exchange them for a larger size, a hassle. I thought New Balance shoes were more uniformly sized, and that was my previous experience. So when I get a chance to wear the size 9's that I had to get in grey/pink, I will leave a better review as my toes hit the tops of these shoes and I had to exchange them!\n",
      "I have purchased two sets of these boots.  I had serious ankle surgery about 4 years ago and cannot wear heels much anymore.  I gave these a shot because I wanted to have something that looked nice and were also comfortable.  They look great with my work clothes (I'm an attorney) and I have gotten several compliments on them.  I'm a little disappointed with my first pair.  The zipper comes disconnected at the bottom of the zipper and I have to occasionally rework that to get it to zip up.  Also, the right heel came loose and clicks a little when I walk.  I bought the second pair and haven't had any issues at all, but I wish there was something that could be done about that darn heel!  I had them less than a year.\n",
      "I bought these for nursing school. I use them for class and lab. I bought a different paid of shoes for when we do our long clinical days, but these are the most comfortable shoes ever! I love them!\n",

      "Great arch support however, these shoes need more cushioning overall in the footbed\n",
      "I love the style of these glasses, however, they distort the real color, they make everything look pink instead of green.\n",
      "These are darling!  The material is much nicer than most wellies/rain boots.  They don't make that obnoxious squish sound when you walk in them, they're warm inside and have a nicer supportive insert.  They're lined with something soft, so the material the boot is made of is not flush against your leg.  My feet also don't sweat in these as they do in most rain boots.  The adjustable buckle is ACTUALLY a buckle that adjusts the width of the boot shaft (rather than just a plastic piece of crap that looks cute but does nothing, as it seems to be on most rain boots).  My feet are slightly wide, though not wide enough to wear a wide shoe and these fit great, even with a thick sock.  I'm an athlete and have very strong calves.  No issues fitting them over, even with leggings or skinny pants.  Love the print too! :)\n",
      "I have worn a lot of running shoes over many, many years! For me, New Balance makes the best shoe. These are very comfortable and look great!\n",
      "I absolutely love love love this purse/wallet.  It is perfect\n",
      "Great! Did not fall in them! Great boot. High and brings out ur calves! Cant wait to get a different color! (got reg boot color)\n",
      "Love them ♥️\n",
      "They fit my daughter perfect and they shipped fast.\n",
      "Awesome shoes!  Just remember you are getting these from China so expect a long delivery time.\n",
      "These shoes were perfect for my trip to Portugal and Spain.  I wore them almost everyday.  The Cobblestones are wicked in Spain but I was not bothered at all with these more stylish than walking shoes.  They gave me enough support and the soles are very sturdy.\n",
      "The sole of both shoes toe came unglued after my third 15+ mile run.\n",
      "They fit and feel great!  Well worth the price\n",
      "Not my most comfortable Vionic shoes. Keeping them but not comfortable enough to wear if doing a lot of walking. The straps over my toes rub. It helped when I tightened the ankle straps. Hopefully they will get better.\n",
      "they are a little bit heavy so that you  hear the steps of your child, but they re comfy for several hours.\n",
      "Lov'em!!! :-)\n",
      "My daughter loves these boots. Cute and comfortable\n",
      "very nice and classy shoes, I like it :))\n",
      "Good\n",
      "muy buen producto\n",
      "Loved them but the 8 was too small - tight @toes & length.  Disappointed that no size 8.5 available to re-order.\n",
      "These shoes look very pretty, but left a blister on the back of my foot the first day of wearing them in the office.  I intended to buy the black color as well when I first received them, but after wearing them I have changed my mind.<br />Size wise they fit true to size, maybe a ted too narrow, but still OK. I wish they were more comfortable.\n",
      "Great shoe. I bought a pair in the past. From another company. Many differnt colors to chose from. Great for walking and running.\n",
      "Awesome shoe!  Very comfortable even w/the height. I am on my feet all day as a teacher & they actually feel good. I even prefer them to a flat. I have a narrow heal, so must wear an insert.\n",
      "All in all a great shoe.  I have bunions so I need wide shoes.  So far Easy Spirit has been the only wide shoe I have found that is actually wide.\n",
      "Great shoe!  I have been wearing them for years!\n",
      "THEY COULD STRENGTHEN THE BOTTOM AND ADD ARCH SUPPORT!\n",
      "I love those shoes. The size I was order is 1 size bigger compare with US size and fit me perfect. Shoes is very elegant, in each shoes lock have a little stone. It's look so beautiful. Bottom of the shoes is have very comfort pad, will help big time if I have to stand or have a long walk. I love it.<br />But my ankle too small to have perfect look in this shoes. I have to use the last hall of shoes halter, then make shoes halter are crooked, and make my ankle look so ugly. But again like I said, that is nothing from the shoes, just because my ankles are too small. So that why I have too bite my toung and return it :( and order one pair similar but no hight halter\n",
      "Great purse with a lot of compartments.\n",
      "Very Pretty\n",
      "Unfortunately they don't come in half sizes. The 7 and 8 both fit as expected, but I really need a 7.5.  No matter, I kept the size 7!  They are super cute, I wear them all the time, and super comfortable.\n",
      "Excellent product . Recommended seller !!\n",
      "They were too big for my face so I returned them however they were nice sunglasses.. Would recommend.\n",
      "Love these sneakers. Have another pair of rosheruns, but these, somehow, are much more comfortable. Highly recommend these!!!!\n",
      "Love these classics! Great shoes for school! Nicer looking than a sneaker but meets all the requirements for sturdy footwear for the playground and gym floors.\n",
      "They are OK for ocassional use\n",
      "good products!\n",
      "Great Boot, Ariat will never let you down!!\n",
      "You can't go wrong with pedipeds!  These look great and fit great and are durable.\n",
      "good product\n",
      "I can't wait to get mine I just ordered black ones! ☺\n",
      "I have been very happy with these boots! As the reviews and info suggested I went up a size and they fit perfect. I've had them for 2 months now and wear daily, anywhere between one-four hours each day. They are starting to crack in some spots from wear, so no longer water proof as I found when I stepped into a river but still perfectly usable for work around our farms and chicken coop. I love the prints and since they are so inexpensive I plan to buy more!\n",
      "Great  pair of shoes my daughter loves them . Thank you for making the purchase as painless as possible.  I'll tell everyone about these shoes.\n",
      "Very cheap looking and poor quality fabric.\n",
      "It's more dressier looking than most Ecco shoes. These will go well with my suits.\n",
      "I love them. I bought them but not sure I would wear them very long. I had them on last night for about 4 hours. That was fine. No problem These are absolutely gorgeous!!!\n",
      "This is only shoes I can ware to walk all day\n",
      "Great\n",
      "So glad I bought these.\n",
      "I bought these years ago not from Amazon but another source.  They used to be wonderful as the first review on here says.  I bought them a second time and now they are as the second reviewer notes.  In other words they are cheaply made foreign junk.  Buyer beware.  Also the picture is deceiving as the heels do not come up over your heels.  They slip off your feet and come apart in a minute.  Garbage.\n",
      "I knew before I bought them that I needed a size smaller than I normally wear in a croc. They are definitely not sized the same.\n",
      "They were the right size and they are evey comfortable.\n",
      "Really good value for the price. The sole is somewhat stiff to me, but thats probably only because I'm used to running shoes with air sole. The leather is pretty thin though, easily wetted by rain. However, the style is great, love the color, and worth the price.\n",
      "Great deal!  It would've been nice to have more men's and not so many ladies.  Awesome price for what you get\n",
      "Good looking, comfortable glasses for tennis.\n",
      "UPDATE: Hiked the Grand Canyon last month and they were perfect!  Great support and comfort.  I suffered from tired legs but my feet didn't hurt at all.  This is a no-brainer purchase.  Do it...<br /><br />Only took one hike so far in these but it was great.  Very supportive and great traction.  I've always been a Timberland fan and these don't disappoint.\n",
      "Based on the comments, I ordered a half a size up and it was perfect (I'm normally US 7.5 - 8 and I ordered a US 8.5).<br />The shoes are very comfortable and they look fantastic.\n",
      "Glasses met expectations - use them for car driving, cycling and general outdoors use\n",
      "Great for wedding after you take off the heels\n",
      "These bedroom shoes are great! .This is the 3rd pair I've purchased, one for me and gifts for others.  The support is so much better than your average bedroom shoes and this is the prettiest shade of light pink!  The price from this seller was terrific and the shipment came through without any issues and before the promised deadline.\n",
      "Original pair ran small, exchanged for larger very expeditiously, good service by supplier\n",
      "Bought this bag at TJMaxx for $10.00. I bought this bag for organization for my large Whipping Post Tote.  Coin purse is big enough to use a wallet for my Dave Ramsey Cash envelope system with come index dividers and I am using a Vera Bradley coin purse. Love that I can have a smaller bag in my tote for when I just need to run into a gas store etc and not have to take my huge tote in!\n",
      "I can see\n",
      "Super  Light!\n",
      "Kind of provides a little arch support.\n",
      "Nice, comfortable.\n",
      "Comfort\n",
      "Everytime I wear these light weight shoes I receive compliments, they are much prettier than the photo.  I ordered the Bronze, they seem to go with everything I wear.  They feel like I am wearing slippers - the soles give grip control that I can walk down a very steep driveway which I did not dare walk even with hiking boots.  I lucked out to get on a lightening sale for $24.99 and really enjoy them.\n",
      "These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  No break-in time required.  Comfortable right out of the box.  Could be on my feet all day with comfort.\n",
      "My son loves this shoe and purchased a second pair because they are so comfortable.\n",
      "Love the shoes.  Very pretty, but also very comfortable.  Goes with shorts, skirts, pretty much anything.\n",
      "The ends of the laces are too thick to fit into one of the pairs of shoes I wanted to lace. Have to use these with a different pair of shoes. I wish 40&#34; were available. These are too long at 45&#34;, but the next length down would have been too short.\n",
      "Very nice color to go with a lot of pastel clothing.  The only caveat I had with this particular slip-on was that the back of the heels needed to be broken in as it was a little stiff at first.\n",
      "These shoes are really comfortable for my wide, flat feet. I spend around 12 to 16 hours on my feet a day, so comfort and support are absolutely necessary. These shoes really deliver. They are not quite as roomy in the toe as my old Brooks shoes. But since Brooks changed their sizing, these have served in their place. I'm taking off one star because for some reason, these shoes squeak like crazy. My patients know when I am coming because they can hear the soles of these shoes squeaking all the way down the hall. I have tried all the tricks I've found online and nothing seems to help. Carpet, linoleum, concrete, or wood... It does not matter. These shoes are loud! I've had them for about five months and worn them at least five days a week since receiving them. It's not the worst thing ever, though. I've learned to deal with it.\n",
      "Beautiful Shoe! Relatively comfortable. Fits well. Foot feels secure in these. While still being sexy. True to size.\n",
      "Has a large capacity for cards is easy to get into. Doesn't take up a lot of room in your purse.\n",
      "I purchased shoes for dual purpose: river crossings and camp shoes for backpacking.  I took liners out to make them lighter.  They are super lightweight and worked great in river and on land.  A bit wide without insert, but I have wide feet so it was no problem.  I like that they can be cinched down for a more snug fit crossing rivers.\n",
      "I ordered these sunglasses because my Ray Ban's just like these got lost. I did not want to pay another $200 so I decided to try these out, and I absolutely love them! So fashionable and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this product to anybody.\n",
      "Love this bag!\n",
      "I have three other pairs of KEEN shoes - one other sandal. This is considerably narrower and ... what? ... shorter? The distance from the bottom of my foot to the top of my foot is sorely squished in these, as is the width of my foot. All my other KEEN shoes and sandals are delightfully comfortable, and are my chosen shoe if I'm going to be on my feet for hours. These almost killed me at a music festival.\n",
      "Good but a little short for the size\n",
      "Super comfortable.  Love these boots!\n",
      "Bought during 50% off. Great deal and quality boat shoe.\n",
      "my granddaughter loved it\n",
      "These shoes run large.  I read the previous reviews and bought it half a size smaller than I normally wear.  They came and were slightly to big but I had bought them to wear to an event that was the next day.  Wore them that evening and they stretched and are now way to big for me.  Its to bad because I really like the shoe and would wear them if they fit.  Buy them small and give yourself the chance to exchange is they don't fit.\n",
      "I wish they made prettier shoes w/ this wonderful support.\n",
      "So cute!!! I loved the color, very girly but won't get dirty quickly. I always swore by brooks for running but these are my new favorite. My second pair. You should buy these!!!\n",
      "I love the look of these shoes and the way they fit.  Was disappointed in the memory foam inside the shoe.  I guess I expected it to be more of the memory foam.  I stand on my feet all day and walk in them.  But I will add some more memory foam.  I ordered a half size bigger than I normally wear, based on the reviews I saw before I ordered.  I like to wear thick fluffy socks in the winter and I think these will allow them.\n",
      "Is good but too large\n",
      "These are great for anyone who struggles to get laces tied or keep them tied.  Easy to install.  Good product.\n",
      "These sandals are perfect for pedicures.  They keep the toes comfortably separated and are sturdy enough to walk in outside.\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Would have been great but it ran that little bit too small\n",
      "I am returning.\n",
      "I have big feet so the narrow toe box in Nike are not for me.\n",
      "unfortunately this pair had a manufacturing defect and had to be returned which sports hub handled gracefully and a full refund was issued. I purchased the same shoes in the past however and juat loved them!!\n",
      "so pretty . i love my sneakers\n",
      "liked them a lot, and will be buying more.\n",
      "They are more beautiful than in the picture and are very comfortable!\n",
      "These shoes are stylish and comfortable.  A big gold star for Jambu.\n",
      "Great pair of boots.\n",
      "These are wonderfully comfortable shoes, nice modest heel, being 5'9, I need to keep the heel height to a minimum and these don't make feel like a giant:). Very attractive, can be worn with slacks or dresses - winner:). I ordered the black lizard and the navy blue.\n",
      "The band around the top was extremely uncomfortable.  They have already been returned as unwearable.\n",
      "My daughter loves these.\n",
      "Cool concept! Little difficult getting in and out of for me though. Kept it though cuz i do love it\n",
      "Gorgeous purse. My wife loves it. Seems to be well made and looks beautiful, if you like beaded bags.\n",
      "Nice pair of flip flops\n",
      "cool\n",
      "I love these shoes, great for lifting, squats, deadlifts, pretty much anything to do with the barbell.\n",
      "Came a day earlier than stated, which is always nice. Product as expected. Started wearing them right away. They are correct size, etc.  I normally wear a 10 1/2, but noted from another reviewer who wears the same size, to order a 10 and they would fit perfectly. So I did, and they did.\n",
      "Definitely my favorite shoes I've worn. Fits perfectly out of the box and these shoes last for a long time.\n",
      "Fotos fine as long you morder half size larger tan usual...<br />As forma the resto, excellent...\n",
      "I'm between an 8 -9. I needed the 40. 39 just a little small. Best sandal I've ever had!!! So comfortable. Love them\n",
      "Great all around shoe - good for work!  Haven't worn them for long period of time yet so not sure on the all day comfort.  Nicely finished on the inside.  Fit true to size!\n",
      "Bought my first pair of these at a running store and paid twice as much.  So when I needed a new pair I checked in with Amazon, and there they were (with 20% off to boot)!  Comfortable and wears well.  Will probably stick with this line next time I need a running shoe.\n",
      "Great style, nice materials, poor fit.\n",
      "Comfortable and classic.  This is my second pair and I have  found them to be a very comfortable walking shoe. Great for travel.  I have waked all over European cities in them.  The versatile, classic style works well with skirts, slacks, jeans, ----- from farmers markets to the opera.  Light weight for packing is a plus!  I have high arches so I can't say they provide good arch support for me, but they may for others.  My feet are never sore at the end or the day. I will buy them as long as they make them!\n",
      "I bought 2 pair of Hot Chocolate Design shoes in size 6.  These flats are roomy and fairly comfortable.  The heels were tight and too small.  I just love the designs though.\n",
      "Perfect for casual fit!!<br />I love it!!!\n",
      "Most comfortable sandals I've ever wore, and this coming from someone who has sensitive feet.\n",
      "Good shoe for the price\n",
      "Very comfortable shoes\n",
      "No problems with product or vendor.\n",
      "Great pair of boots. Great fit and quality.\n",
      "Was worried bc of the reviews, but these are perfect. Wore them straight out of the box on a hiking trip. Comfortable and fit perfect. I normally wear thick socks to get the roll down effect, but these don't need em. Matches everything and they look FANTASTIC with leggings.\n",
      "I bought these boots for early season hunting as well as hiking. I like the fact that they were Gore-Tex and very lightweight. I wore them on a recent trip to Glacier National Park, where I hiked 35 miles in 2.5 days, and these boots were excellent! I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a breathable, lightweight hiking/hunting boot. The ankle support is excellent as well. The only thing I could possibly gripe about is that these do seem to run a smidge narrow. My feet are somewhat wide, and these still fit great, but were a bit snug. Perhaps that's what you want in a good hiking boot though, as it provides more support.\n",
      "THANK SO MUCH I SUFFER FROM DIABETIC NEUROPATHY AND THIS TYPE OF SHOES WORKS WELL FOR ME. DANNY.\n",
      "Great price for a beautiful boot\n",
      "Actually I wear a size 9M so I should expect them to be too small. With this shoe 9.5 fits the best, even size 9 is not comfortable. I LOVE THESE SHOES THOUGH!!!!! If you can order a half size up, you would have a good fit, probably because of the pointed toes. The shoe is GORGEOUS and the heel height is perfect for wearing with ankle pants and skinny jeans.\n",
      "A little large for my size 10 feet but very comfortable\n",
      "like them\n",
      "Everything ok\n",
      "I've never had a 'tennis shoe' boot before, and LOVE this pair! They provide awesome support, yet are light weight enough that I can wear these all day (and I have) with ZERO straining issues on my knees. They are comfortable, yet rugged. Recommend.  :)\n",
      "Love Clark's sandals.\n",
      "They are great! Good price + really great service!<br />Thank you\n",
      "I like the shoes\n",
      "I've been trying to get ahold of sneaker star for a week now to exchange my shoes for a pair of one's that are a half size bigger. No response. I need an address to send the shoes back so I can exchange them for a half size larger but I can't get an email back.\n",
      "Looks exactly as it does in the picture. Great size and great quality!\n",
      "Great! Fits perfectly. She has narrow feet though. I don't think people with wide feet would find them as comfortable.\n",
      "No more than what I expected. Bottom is a bit mor slippery than I'd like it though. Fast shipping. Worth it.\n",
      "I love these shoes! I got the black leather ones. The size, style, fit, color, and description is exactly what I received! I was intrigued by the low cut above the toes. It is not your usual coverage of the entire toe area: the crevice between big toe and next one peeks out. I think that looks great! The straps above the ankle fit well. I plan on getting another pair in a different color. I am very pleased with these shoes and would highly recommend.\n",
      "Love them I bought my mom a pair to she loves hers\n",
      "Strap shorter than expected\n",

      "Loved this pump, perfect for a formal night out, even prettier in person.\n",
      "love keens - last for kids!\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Two narrow in the foot, to wide in the heal, i just need laces on my shoes.\n",
      "It was my fault.  I didn't read that they were women's boots.  I ordered and of course fit too small.\n",
      "These are my favorite shoes in the world!  Naturalizers seem to fit my wide feet well, and these are so comfortable and give good support.  I need a casual shoe that doesn't look too &quot;clunky&quot;. I don't like pointy toes and I don't like rounded toes that look like a clown's shoe. These are perfect.  I got my first pair fitted at a shoe store, and when I ordered another pair online I was pleased that the fit and quality were the same.\n",
      "Bought sz 3 for my 7.5 yr old, fits great.\n",
      "Didn't fit well.\n",
      "LOVE IT\n",
      "I love the shoe but it was too narrow!  Had to return.\n",
      "Fits as expected and keeps my daughter's feet dry.\n",
      "Do not order these online, as the size is not accurate.\n",
      "I needed more something that had better cushioning and they do not provide it.\n",
      "I have worn mine for the past 4 winters.....I need new ones but sadly it seems they are no longer available.\n",
      "I have narrow feet and I have trouble finding shoes to fit.  Naturalizer used to be the brand I turned to but they don't work anymore.  I was hoping these shoes listed as AA width would fit because I like the design.  But they just don't fit even when I insert innersoles.  I am dissappointed<br />that I have to return them.\n",
      "So small\n",
      "Second pair of Gel-Noosa shoes.  Love them!\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "My son picked these as his school shoes\n",
      "Absolutely love the look. I am a size 5.5 or 6, and boy am I  glad that I ordered a 6. They are the the correct length, but so narrow that my feet are nearly falling asleep ... I mean they are so tight - and I have normal/ slightly narrow feet! To compensate, I would highly suggest a half size larger than normal (though I don't know how much that would even help... I mean these guys are crazy narrow). My hope and guess is that after a few weeks of wear they'll stretch.\n",
      "Bad quality ans size z really big... :/\n",
      "Item was as described and shipped A S A P.  Great seller!\n",
      "Excellent Quality ...\n",
      "I love this sandals, beautiful and comfortable!\n",
      "Tried to return this shoe was hardest thing.\n",
      "good pair of shoes. my girlfriend loves it\n",
      "Ok\n",
      "i wear them all day on concrete floor standing, with my othropedic inserts\n",
      "Such a great shoe and I got it at a steal. I know NW shoes run narrow, so I went up half a size, but now it's a little too long as they've stretched with wear (nothing that heel grips wont fix) They did scuff easily though\n",
      "The bag came earlier than i expected and so far its pretty great. The quality is nice and i love the style :)\n",
      "As expected but a little large\n",
      "Nice and comphy shoe. Looks good and can be used for light hiking.\n",
      "Fabulous shoe. Even on my first day of wearing, no points where I feel uncomfortable or pain. The strap around the ankle area is very comfortable, giving stability without constraint. I am tempted to order more pairs in case they are ever discontinued. I travel a lot overseas and these are going with me.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Came apart too easily.\n",
      "I ordered a size 11 US, because I own other Clark's dress shoes. These are way too long! I am returning and ordering a size 10 US to replace them. Otherwise, they look great and are comfortable.\n",
      "As expected.  Good looking shoe.\n",
      "I wear these in my studio during the summer months when it's too hot for boots. The floors are concrete, and these shoes have been comfortable for months. I don't expect them to last longer than a year, but for the price and what I put them through, I am more than happy with this purchase.\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "I just love these things! So easy to put on and put away. light weight. doesn't hurt my nose. I do forget they are on. But, I'm kind of stuck between the 1.5 and 2.0 strengths. I have one of each now and will continue to experiment until I decide which I want. Then I will buy one for each room in the house and one in the car and one in the purse. Then I'll have replaced all the regular readers with something I like. I will get each color too. I was thinking that I would like them to be &#34;shorter&#34; up and down length of the lens. Just a bit. But now with the 1.5 strength, the size seems just right. I'll probably stick with the 1.5 strength for the rest of the ones I buy.\n",
      "LOvE Sanuks. Fit true to size. COMFY!!!\n",
      "Beautiful. Packaged to lay flat, but shapes up so perfectly upon opening package.\n",
      "The shoes is awesome and the size fits very well.\n",
      "The brown polish doesn't hold up to a 5 year old boy\n",
      "The boot is sewen wrong so your foot cannot fit into it!\n",
      "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the product for the price. The pleather is actually very supple and smooth and did not look cheap. Though I wore these all day as a bridesmaid, they were not initially comfortable. The heel is very hard but the addition of some cheap, clear insoles made the shoes much more comfortable.  Also, the flat gold flat fake &#34;clasp&#34; that holds the chain hook hit right on the outside of my ankle bones. That area was slightly bruised the next day after 8+ hours of wear. If you are wearing a long dress with these shoes, prepare for snagging. The clasp/chain snagged on the thule of my dress several times while sitting down thankfully I did not see any tears.<br /><br />Overall, the quality was better than I expected and for the price the shoe lasted me through a wedding and will be worn again for special occasions. Definitely plan to buy a pair of insoles.\n",
      "Barely fitted on my feet.\n",
      "appeared larger than it is; very cute; however  VERY small.\n",
      "Great looking rain boots at a great price.  He hasn't worn them in inclement weather yet, but unless they leak, I'd say they're well worth the money.\n",
      "Love the shoes!!!\n",
      "Excellent gym shoe.  Good with weight lifting, good for cross training.  Excellent arch support.\n",
      "Awesome boots for the price! Quality construction and materials.<br /><br />Great for gardening and rainy outdoor activities. Ample room to tuck pants inside.<br /><br />My only complaint is that size 8 runs a tad larger than expected. If you normally wear 8s, I suggest going down at least 1/2 a size on these.\n",
      "Uncomfortable\n",
      "Love these shoes...so very comfortable, right from the very first step!  It would be lovely if the straps were a bit longer.  I also wish that all colors were the same price.  I really, really wanted these in black but that color was 20+ dollars more then this purple and one other color.  I'll be danged if I was going to pay that much more for the same shoe.  For that I only giving it 4 stars.\n",
      "I had one pair that was too small so I ordered one size up. That helped, but they still rub. They are just too pricey to not be more comfortable.\n",
      "These are awsome sauce!! Very much what I expected and the price amazing.\n",
      "Good support, comfortable, well made, worth the money.  No quibbles..\n",
      "Love the Jambus and the red is so pretty. This is my replacement pair as I have about worn out my last pair. The deal on this pair from Amazon was too good to pass up. They arrived perfectly wrapped. Thank you!!\n",
      "First time since 2012 I've found running shoes that work for me. Only reason I did not give them a &#34;5 star&#34; is based on the color. Their orange/black looks more like fluorescent pink/black.\n",
      "It came very quickly and I absolutely love it! Best product I have purchased off of amazon so far!\n",
      "I received these glasses very quickly!  I love them.  they fit my face and look - received many compliments.<br />just wish they came with a case - oh well!!<br />Tova\n",

      "Love them. I get compliment when I wear them. So cute.\n",
      "The faux leather peels off very easily\n",
      "I used to have a pair like these and was so excited when I saw them. they arrived 2 weeks before they were suppose to, and fit very nicely. They were so comfortable I was able to walk all day in them.\n",
      "I walked around the house with these boots on and the heel doesn't feel as high as it looks. I was surprised, in a good way.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "I loved him unfortunately they're too small for my big head :)<br />So I have to return them even though I like them\n",
      "They look nice but are very uncomfortable if you have to walk any notable distance. I ran in them for only 500 feet to catch a plane and they tore up my heels to the point that they were bleeding.\n",
      "I travelled with this less than half a dozen times and now the retractable multistage wheel handle has become stuck and unusable.  The time this occurred I was about to pass through airport security to board a flight and had to hammer it in to retract it before I could place it on the x-ray conveyor belt.  The laptop sleeve buried at the bottom is also not a good idea as every time I pass through airport security I have to dig my laptop out from a pile of clothing.\n",
      "Great shoes, not great for walking though. Don't wear if your planning on being on your feet for a long period of time.\n",
      "I ordered the wrong size. I did try them on, and they were extremely comfy. Cute, too.\n",
      "Love my bag! I get lots of compliments on it.\n",
      "GOOD QUALITY , GOOD DELIVERY\n",
      "I have about 250 miles on these shoes and they're holding up O.K. I buy Newtons half a size larger than a Nike and that seems about right.\n",
      "muy buen producto\n",
      "Excellent , comfortable shoe!!!\n",
      "My son wears a size 3.5. I bought these for school (which starts tomorrow), but these are extremely large compared to the stated size. However, they are really nicely made. I plan to order him a smaller size and just keep the bigger ones for later :)\n",
      "I just received my boots today it came a day early and they look just like the picture omg they are so cute perfect fit enough room for when i wear thick socks I love them and i can not wait to wear them\n",
      "Love these shoes bought in 2 different colors!  I didn't expect their to be arch support but if you are looking for that these are not the right show!\n",
      "this is my third pair, i love it very comfortable.  i even wear it on my days off.\n",
      "I LOVE THEM.  I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT A GOOD DEAL I WAS GETTING.  I WEAR THEM ONLY IN THE HOUSE.  YOU, HOWEVER COULD WEAR THEM ANYWHERE.\n",
      "No joke,man,if you know how to use it<br />this stuff will make your leather gear shine.<br />This has been my preferred polish going<br />on forty five years.<br />I've seen reviews by people who freaked out<br />when the polish arrived cracked,off color etc,<br />Never happened to me,but,if it happens to<br />you don't panic and don't start it on fire or<br />you'll vaporize essential oils.<br />Just take off the lid and warm the polish in the<br />the can by sunshine,hair dryer,hot water etc.<br />Remember,warm the can not the polish.\n",
      "The boots were beautiful. The length was perfect. However, the top of the shoe, at the base of the lashes was so tight I could barely stand it. I have a high arch, but I have never had a boot fit so tightly on the top of my foot. Broke my heart to return them.\n",
      "These shoes were very cute, but also very uncomfortable. I could only wear them for maybe an hour and that was after I got get inserts for them.\n",
      "Excellent shoes to wear\n",
      "Fast shipping! Awesome shoes!\n",
      "Very nice shoes\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Very good boost\n",
      "The item does not fit like Havanas you buy from the actual store the straps are big.\n",
      "So far these shoes are great, however, I rarely find shoes with enough arch support for me, these are no exception.\n",
      "This small wallet holds much and is a perfect size to fit in any bag I own. Love it.\n",
      "Wish they were a little wider\n",
      "The shoes started out comfortable.<br /><br />But they are not all meant to wear anywhere near a beach shoes.  I got sand in them and decided to wash them on a light wash in washing machine and the tore up\n",
      "Love, Love, LOVE these boots.  They are def one of my FAVOURITE of all times.  I do body work and wear these for 8-13 hours straight doing massage.  I was shocked that they are so comfortable.  I've had them re-soled twice since the blacks are out of stock.  I bought both colours.  Great buy!!!\n",
      "Love 'em, just love, love, love 'em. So very comfortable and unlike the traditional flops!! Get u a pair or two!!\n",
      "Lightweight shoe\n",
      "Yep, muted fall colors that will go with everything.<br />Yep, feels sturdy with reasonable construction.<br />Yep, medium bag will hold iPad and more.<br />Yep, I think it's unisex.<br /><br />I'll get good use from this bag, taking it with me for appointments where I have to wait (doctors, dentists). I think students will find it handy for holding supplies and a book or two. I carry small purses which will fit in the medium bag.\n",
      "These shoes look great but don't feel that great. The length is as expected but they run narrow. The left show also fits a bit high on my heel and rubs a sore spot.\n",
      "Perfect for dressy wear.\n",
      "The toe box of these shoes turn up like a clowns or a jester shoe... They are being returned, obviously Easy Spirit has seen fit to<br />sell a defective product... These are dangerous.\n",
      "Love them. I just havn't had the chance to really wear them yet.\n",
      "These are from heaven!  They're comfortable and I feel super stylish in them.\n",
      "Comfortable and elegant pair of shoes. I love J.D. Fisk shoes.\n",
      "So comfy and cute. When on, they have a bit of a beatnik look that I really enjoy. They are very comfortable--I'm a teacher so I'm on my feet a lot, and I can wear these all day long. They go with everything and were very affordable\n",
      "I am very excited in regards to the Vera Bradley backpack!  I got it because there are times I have to go to the doctor or on errands with my husband who has Parkinson's and is in a wheelchair.  My purse would constantly slip off the shoulder but now I can put the stuff in the backpack and on my back without the constant slipping I now experience.\n",
      "Item was as described and shipped A S A P. Great seller!<br /><br />These are the coolest most comfy shoes I have ever owned. They are great for walking and standing long periods of time. The mesh material is cool and they are machine washable.\n",
      "I bought them for winter, so haven't worn them yet, but they seem extremely comfortable. Good arch support and a high padded collar which provides good ankle support. They also look good. Think they will be perfect for winter traveling and walking in wet, cold weather. They are also surprisingly lightweight.\n",
      "They're OK, but I had another pair by Jambu that I LOVED and these do not compare.\n",
      "Got these when I made a goal to start running.  They have held up pretty well and are turning out to be a great shoe.\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "Very comfortable.  Order a half of size larger nd firs perfect.\n",
      "Beautiful and I got many compliments\n",
      "This purse was great until the bottom metal part started cutting through the lining on the bottom inside. It is either the clip holding the seatbelt together or maybe the clip holding the feet on the bottom of the purse. I was told by this company they were going to replace my purse and I sent them my information and then I never heard another word from them.<br />Be careful. I get lots of compliments on this purse from men and women. Too bad it isn't lasting very long.\n",
      "Bought for wife. Light and strappy like a sandal<br />Comfy and supportive like a shoe\n",
      "Great sandle, will buy again!!\n",
      "Beautiful shoes\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Well the supra shoes was too small. I'll to pre order another shoes of this to try again. Thank you.\n",
      "The sandals are very very comfortable! I wear a size six and a half and they fit me perfectly so if you are a size 7 I would recommend going up to a size 8 as they would be too small for you otherwise.\n",
      "Great size. Nice design and quality.\n",
      "Beautiful bag! However, I thought I was receiving the one pictured. Would be nice to let people know that they will not receive the one in the photo.\n",
      "My daughter just love them/\n",
      "Good shoe! I am so used to things being narrower than expected, I went to the 4E, which was a little wide for me.<br />Not so wide, i could not wear them, but wider than i'd like if I ran alot.<br />Again not Asics fault, I ordered them.  They seem true to size & are very lightweight.\n",
      "Great running shoes... reqady for the next 400 miles !!\n",
      "Nice sturdy white framed sunglasses. I used them for a stage production and they did the job!\n",
      "I switched from Footjoy golf shoes to these skechers.  They took a few rounds to break in but once they did they are immensely comfortable.  The support is slightly less than my footjoys, but i like to wear my shoes a little loose anyway.  I have played about 40 rounds in them and they are holding up really well.  I use a little vinyl/leather conditioner to ocassionally clean them up.  Love these shoes and would definitely recommend a try for anyone considering them.\n",
      "I returned for credit the wide width was still too narrow. I always fit in a &#34;standard&#34; wide width\n",
      "Love these.  It took forever to find a pair of shoes I liked, but these were perfect!  So happy with these shoes.\n",
      "Compfy.  Durable.  Cute.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Fit was great, unfortunately after on outing they were scratched and the material at the top peeled right off. No longer presentable for school...very disappointed\n",
      "Loved the show. Fearful about zipper quality.\n",
      "I love these. I have wide feet and by the end of the day these can feel a little too narrow, but overall they are really comfortable. I love that they are minimalist shoes because I feel so comfortable and the next best thing to barefoot. I work in an elementary school and I'm either walking a lot or sitting on the floor, these shoes are great for both. I love the grey because it's goes with pretty much everything.\n",
      "Okay and get the job done, but they will last only one season. Cute, comfy and my boys loved them, but the inserts at the bottom on the insoles started falling out after a couple wears and the tie on the back started to fray.\n",
      "Pretty good quality for the price,  but shoes run really narrow!\n",
      "These shoes look great and seem well made. I ordered my normal size as I have owned many pairs of Asics. They're basically the only sneakers I buy. These were much narrower than Asics usually are. They rubbed the side of my foot raw. Unfortunately I had to return.\n",
      "These shoes were way too small. I ordered a size 7 and they may have fit a size 5.\n",
      "soft comfy in general great\n",
      "This kind fine, no problem\n",
      "Like the retro look & feel of these shoes.  Light and comfortable on my feet.\n",
      "Like the shoes. Haven't really worn them much yet. Will accommodate socks for winter.\n",
      "My daughter loves these shoes--absolutely no complaints!\n",
      "Fit as others I have purchased\n",
      "These are heavy shoes.  My former shoes were Red Wing and quite a lot lighter.<br />Wore these all day the first day with no sore spots.  Does rub a bit on the Achilles, they are higher in the back than I am used to.\n",
      "These are great. I'm a bit of a chuck taylor fanatic but these are much better than chucks. They are more comfortable, in my opinion better looking, better built and more durable than chucks. The tounge is flimsy just like chucks which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on preference. I get tons of compliments on these shoes. I like them alot.\n",
      "Love these shoes, so comfortable and fit perfect!\n",
      "Bought these in size 8C, my feet swell or grew since I turned 60.  First, they are awesome looking, a beautiful shoe.  However they are tight thru the toes and the heels are a solid 3&#34; and a bit higher than I wanted for my bad back.  Did I mention beautiful, I love their look!  I wanted to order them in navy or even red but my first pair were $25, and now they are $40 to $60.  Yikes!  I hope when I wear them over 5 minutes, I can say they are comfy.  The larger diameter heel I hope will make me steady on my feet and help the comfort.  I'll add an additional note if they are more comfortable in the wearing at an event.<br />Striking shoe, I was very amazed.\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "Bought these for my husband who has a super high arch and a wide foot. They fit mostly as expected and he can wear them comfortably . I really like the shoes.<br />I do wish that they would make the z strap for men\n",
      "I really like this sandals, but they don't fit,  a little too small.so I really don't know what to do with it. So I gave it to a homeless person in the Street.\n",
      "Been buying these shoes for years. Fits great and last a long time.\n",
      "Awesome shoe for the little ones!\n"

    "reviews = '''Do not buy: really didn't start to wear them until May of 2016. Junk, they are falling apart. The outer sole is so thin that although I wear them almost completely in the house on rugs the inner padding is showing through in the heel. My previous pair from the same company lasted 5 years before I threw them out.  I'm sorry I didn't wear them more often when I first got them as I would have returned them immediately\n",

    "My 13 year old son loved these shoes excellent quality service and on time for his Birthday !!!\n",
    "Ok, I have been searching for shoes to replace the shoes I used to wear but are now too crazy expensive. (wanna guess?) I am so happy with these, I did get them on sale, which helped me a lot, but honestly, these are truly worth more. The\\y are so comfortable, the arch is awesome, the cushioning, which is my number one issue (fat woman, 35 years working intensive care) is amazing. I love that the tongue is super thin and doesn't get in the way. I love the lacing system, but i needed a little more room in the shoe, some days it works great, other days i wish i just had one more inch, lol. Are you looking for an amazing shoe? Cushioning, smooth rocker bottom?? These are them, I couldn't be happier. I also introduced them to another friend who worked ICU with me for many years, she bought them and adores them too!!! (yes they are a little on the narrow side, just be aware)\n",
    "I went a full size down and they fit better but these are kinda wide.  Nonetheless I love them!\n",
    "I would have to say this is boot is very good for my line of work and I buy a pair every year.\n",
    "The size is misleading!\n",
    "These shoes are very comfortable.\n",
    "I love these sandals!\n",
    "Good quality shoes. Great for casual or business attire. Lots of compliments!\n",
    "My daughter really likes those shoes. They are comfortable and fit well.The black started to fade already after only a couple of weeks but they are still good shoes.\n",
    "It's okay .\n",
    "Love these shoes! Perfect fit, very comfortable even walking on concrete floors for 10 hours. They look good, feel sturdy. Excellent product, amazing value.\n",
    "Good\n",
    "I like the go walk3 more than go walk. The textile is too hard.\n",
    "Kids love them for comfort, great price.\n",
    "Tissue paper is this thicker than this.  It ripped while putting on.  I should have paid attention to the reviews.\n",

    "Cute & comfy\n",
    "Absolutely love!!\n",
    "Very sturdy. A great travel tote - lots of pockets and back pocket unzips at the bottom so you can place the bag over the handle of your suitcase for easy transport. Never travel without it!\n",
    "Comfortable just a little loose on my feet.\n",
    "it is comfortable\n",
    "Everithing was good\n",
    "I love this bag! I saw it at a boutique store for $78 and decided to see if it was on Amazon. Such a great price and it's an awesome, well-made bag w/ oodles of pockets for easy organization. Plus - lovely color!!\n",
    "Nice shoes but a little snug.\n",
    "Nice durability, comfortable and stylish.\n",
    "This pair of Sketchers is now the second pair I've bought, where the left shoe does not fit as well as the right.  The left is slightly loose.  I have the first pair of Go Walk Sketchers I bought, and they fit fine, so I have to assume the fault does not lie with my left foot.  Disappointed, given the price.\n",
    "I have flat feet that are large in width so the 1st few times they were a bit snug & uncomfortable to wear. After those few times they are most comfy casual shoes yet ......the material is made from bamboo so didn't help with the comfort the first few times wearing them either :(\n",
    "The boots are lights ,very confortable but the only thing that I did  not liked was are so tall.\n",
    "Not what I expected would not order again\n",
    "This is my second pair but different color. excellente.\n",
    "Slippers are adorable and so soft on the inside!  Love the rubber sole too.  Very comfortable!  My size is 8 and read from some reviewers that it runs a little larger in size, so I did go with size 6.5-7.5 and it fits wonderfully.\n",
    "It is larger than I anticipated.  I have not used it yet but it is brand new and will work great.\n",
    "Returned for a pair of Asics Cumulus. They were just okay, I ordered too big which was my own fault but I really didn't like the look of them all that much anyway once I got them. Not enough arch support for me, personally. Width was good, I have a wide foot. I'm kind of glad I didn't order the right size because I would have probably kept them. I am so much happier with the Asics I bought instead- I feel like I'm walking on a cloud. These shoes felt a little stiff like cardboard.\n",
    "Arch and ankle support are critical in this type of boot. This boots has that.\n",
    "These boots were order as the 9c which is the wide width when we received them the box and the shoes were marked 9b when we went to return these we were told that they were 9c's and were just mismarked well they were too narrow so we are now returning for refund would not suggest these if you are looking for a wide width.\n",
    "I love these shoes! I got them to wear around town because they look cute and comfortable, and they are. I added some insoles to add extra arch support for long walking days. Overall, excellent boots!\n",
    "I have had great luck with Brooks running shoes. They offer great stability and effectively cushion my feet.\n",
    "Very nice\n",
    "Fits as expected, fast delivery, very pleased.\n",
    "Cheep, made in China although they advertised as made in America, and they were a size too big. They are going back.\n",
    "Love them! I ordered a 1/2 size larger than normal.they fit perfect.great gym shoe.\n",
    "I initially bought an 11 and to exchange for a 12.They're fine now. I usually wear an 11 so I  guess they ran a little small. It could be the style of shoe rather than a dress oxford.\n",
    "Merrell are great boots, fit and feel great. I wear them everyday and on concrete floors. This is my third pair!\n",
    "Love these shoes!  Best hiking shoe i've ever had!\n",
    "Love these sandals!  Cushioning and comfortable yet attractive and easy to put on!\n",
    "To be fair they didn't fit me, which doesn't mean that they don't fit. Brooks makes a great shoe with great arch support.\n",
    "They're a lot darker than pictured. If backlit, you can see the tortoiseshell pattern but otherwise they just look a very dark brown. This was a bit disappointing to me but otherwise they're a good pair of sunglasses, they look well-made and they feel sturdy.\n",
    "love my boston's and now I love these. Finally they made a male flip flop.  Great comfort.\n",
    "Happy with the purchase\n",
    "I love it\n",
    "i do love the  sparkle of this bag,,,after all that was one of the reasons for purchasing it.... HOWEVER.... it is MISSING 2 RHINESTONE STUDS in the same area so the missing studs are quite noticeable! The other reason for the purchase is I like LARGE bags,,,while the size of this bag is okay the opening is small... disappointed in that...but oh well  when ordering online it is always a hit or miss!\n",
    "Perfect\n",
    "For my wife and she is super excited to have them for her first trip to Disney!\n",

    "I loooooove this product so so much &#60;3.<br />It makes me look cool like superman\n",
    "I love these shoes.  So comfortable!\n",
    "Really love this style of shoe.  More sturdy than a slip on, but less bulky than a true sneaker. I had a pair in yellow that I got all greasy from biking, so I switched over to black.  They're holding up well, comfortable, and seem like they would survive a run through the washing machine if I wanted to clean them up.  Very happy with my purchase.\n",
    "Sweet\n",
    "Excellent shoe, great quality great price.\n",
    "I had to add inserts to the back of my heel because the size 6.5 was too small ad the size 7 was too big.  I have narrow heels.  With the inserts (they stick the the inside back of the shoe) they fit great!\n",
    "Terrific shoe at a reasonable price promptly delivered. Thanks!\n",
    "These boots have the typical timberland comfort.  They are not heavy to wear all day.  I do find that I need to lace them up pretty tight to keep my toes from rubbing the composite protective toe on the boot but all in all they seem like a good boot right from the box.  My rule of thumb is to get 1 year for every $100 I spend.  I would guess that in roughly a year the soles will start cracking which is also typical for timberland boots.  But they are work boots and I do beat them up for that year, and quite honestly they are comfortable.\n",
    "My grandson Sam loved them. He couldn't wait to try them on and show them to his cousins!\n",
    "Love them\n",
    "Oakley are always excellent quality glasses. The lenses are a nice strong green color that can't be seen through when worn.\n",
    "perfect fit and you can add another sole for extra comfort\n",
    "These shoes are by far the most comfortable wedges I've ever put on my feet. I HATE wearing heals but I love these shoes! I own them in black as well.\n",
    "I ordered this pair for my mother who has swollen feet and she LOVES these shoes!  She said they're comfortable, she likes the fact she can adjust the strap as needed, and they have fantastic support.  She wears these shoes all day long.  She has raved about them so much that I'm ordering a pair for myself!!\n",
    "I have purchased the sneaker before in the stores in white in a size 81/2. My true closed shoe size is 10.  Based on the reviews I decided to order the 9 and they fit perfect! So, measured your feet ladies and go with those measurements.\n",
    "Not as comfortable as they look\n",
    "It's a nice shoe that gives an outfit a pop of color.  Not a shoe to wear for periods of time if you have problem feet.\n",
    "The only complaint I have about these shoes is they do rub on the back of my heel, giving me a blister but they are extremely comfortable.  I would go up 1/2 size from what you normally wear in them too.\n",
    "I love these shoes. They are the most comfortable shoe I have found. The trouble is that I keep having to replace them every few months because  the soles separate from the shoes. Maybe New Balance could find out what kind of glue the other brands use because I am on my forth and final pair unless the quality control improves.\n",
    "My husband had the same shoes in another color.<br />Every day he had to walk 30min to work, and after work.<br />Very comfortable shoes\n",
    "As described\n",
    "I was actually very impressed with this little bag. I purchased mine in Coffee color. Shipping was fast.<br /><br />Every compartment zips which is nice with keeping things in. The main compartment has son padding witch gives the bag done structure and helps protect an iPad. It holds quite a bit but it's not a huge bag, my iPad mini fits nicely in its case with room to spare. The side pockets are great for an iPhone 5 in a fitted case but an iPhone 6 would be to big but the many othe pockets would work nicely.<br />The strap is soft and comfortable. The zippers are smooth and functional. My only complaint is the lining is a little cheap but it does not bunch up and get in the way.<br /><br />I usually carry Fossil or Vera Bradley bags. I got this for something different and small.\n",
    "Nice boots, purchased for short term protection during floods.  They are a little hot for southern weather, but are perfect to wear to get in and out of cars and buildings during heavy rains.\n",
    "These are super cute!  I wish they had been around when I got married!!  I was worried that it would be hard to see where I was going with the lettering and designs in the way, but it was just fine.  I could see without a problem.  I can't wait to give these to my brother and his soon to be wife at their wedding!  I was able to purchase these at a discount in exchange for my honest review.\n",
    "The purse is very pretty, but the clasp is very hard to open.  I was disappointed with this purse because of this.\n",
    "Very comfortable fits like they should got a great deal thanks to Amazon\n",
    "Before I purchase, I read a review which was about its small size. So, I ordered size 7 even though I usually wear 7.5 or 8. However, size 6 was arrived to my home. The funny thing was it fits to me and I am wearing the shoes. Consequently, tt is way smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Besides the size thing, it is comfortable and easy to wear and take off. If you are considering buying this, one thing you need to notice is that the rare part of the shoes is lower than common shoes.<br /><br />I satisfied this purchase but I gave 4 stars because of its small size.\n",
    "Second pairs of this model Gel-Kayano (#21). Fit as expected (they always run 1/2 size small).  I always order a second pair before the model changes - just in case the next one is off (happens every few years). Great support for narrow, flat, overprinting feet. I clock at least 15 miles/week walking and even used them for some light hiking recently (although it was a bit rough on them). I still have second pair in the box.\n",
    "I am a nurse and on concrete all day;  love the cushion;\n",
    "So far; so good. Bought these as a &#34;one pair does everything&#34; traveling shoe. After the first month of ownership and the first week-long trip I'm really satisfied. Shoes hold a shine well, look good with casual outfits, and will pass as dress shoes. Sizing seems to run true. I don't have any special arch support issues so I can't make a judgement on that attribute. The shoes are SUPER light weight, yet seem to be sturdy. The real test will be to see how long they last. (Hopefully this pair will be much better than the Keens they replaced.)\n",
    "I have bought at least a half a dozen pairs of these over the years. I love them. They mold to your feet and give great support. I wear them all year round. This pair, however, seemed to be a bit larger. My toes are sneaking out over the top edge and they are the same size I always get. I have never had that problem before. Makes me think I need to try shoes on rather than ordering online, even if it is the ones I have bought many times.\n",
    "Attractive style although a little wide.\n",
    "Not sized right.\n",
    "I bought these to wear at work (because I worked in a greenhouse, wet feet was an issue) and they were perfect for that because they were made to be wet, had  some traction, and protected my whole foot. When they arrived one of the eyelet guard things was broken, which was annoying but not something I cared to complain over. However, after less than a month of wearing them they began to rip apart at the seams. Sort of disappointing, I was hoping they would last a bit longer. Maybe I was expecting too much, to hope that a $35 pair of shoes would last for more than a month.\n",
    "Veri nice boots<br />Just to go out nothing special<br />Material should be more better.\n",
    "Just what I expected excellent\n",

    "So freakin' cute!!! Love these & wearing them in Paris next month ❤️\n",
    "I like these, but not as much as the MT610V2s that these were meant to replace. They are great walking and light hiking shoes. They are sub-par running shoes compared to the MT610V2 versions.\n",
    "Loved the shoe but too small and did not come in my size.\n",
    "Great shoes for racquetball according to my husband for whom I ordered these.\n",
    "ASICS makes an excellent shoe for walking, just as they do for running. This one is incredibly comfortable. I'm on my feet all day, and this shoe is a winner.\n",
    "Bought these for my dad and he loves them!\n",
    "Very nice quality. I have large Oakley sunglasses and it fits them perfectly. Micro fiber bag and cloth are a real plus.\n",
    "I LOVE REEF flops!!!\n",
    "Love Reebok classics! Best fitting and most comfortable shoe. I'm on my feet at least 12 hours a day and my feet always feel great.\n",
    "They are legit and the price is great!\n",
    "Shoes are as great as I had expected from amazon.  Good job, thank you jerry\n",
    "Ouch what is going on in the front of these shoes? They pinched my toes badly.  Too bad they were cute but had to return.\n",
    "These shoes are great.  Very comfortable.  I wear a 5.5 and they are the perfect fit.  I am going to buy more in different colors.\n",
    "I like the style of the shoes. There is zero support though. Keds aren't known as an orthotic shoe so this is not unexpected. The ortholite footbed does almost nothing. The sole is thin so you can feel the unevenness of the ground/ pavement when you are out walking. For this reason, I would never recommend these shoes for walking. To run around to stores or anywhere indoors, they are fine as long as you add your own support inserts. I could not wear them for any extended period of time without my own insert.\n",
    "I'm in love with these! I get comments all the time. Perfect product for the price. Also comes with protective case and cleaning wipe so that is a bonus. If these came in additional colors I would for sure purchase more\n",
    "Ordered a size larger and still to small.\n",
    "Most comfortable kitchen shoes I've ever owned.\n",
    "Sent them back\n",
    "Nice shoe....runs a little small.  I would suggest buying one size bigger.\n",

    "Good comfortable shoes. Fits nice and are affordable. What else could u ask for.\n",
    "loved it\n",
    "these shoes are are super comfortable!\n",
    "Super!\n",
    "Falling apart after only two times wearing them. Would not buy again.\n",
    "Loved the color and look of the shoes, the width was just fine. But....a few of the reviewers mentioned the shoes were running big.....they're recommendation was to get the shoes 1 size smaller....I did, that's why they were sent back!<br />TOO SMALL!  Doesn't even begin to express how small they were.....!<br /><br /> If anyone else is reading my review, just be aware of their comments, and then, buy the real size of shoes you normally wear.....!\n",
    "Just bought, feel light and very soft but need some time to check durability.\n",
    "Love them\n",
    "The back is too tall and very uncomfortable. I wore them and left my house in the morning and had to return in the afternoon to change them because they had already cut my upper heel. I love this brand but I do not recommend this model.\n",
    "I have 8/12 by 4E which might as well be a square foot or a Hobbits. New balance is the only shoe I can trust to buy online without trying on first.\n",
    "This BackPack is great. Very sturdy. Only thing gripe is the zippers on the front end. Sometimes they get stuck. I hope nothing worse comes of that issue. Either way, great value and i know this will last me at least 2 years or so.\n",
    "Bad this product is ugly , my girlfriend cut me of for this item\n",
    "Have always been a J Renee fan.  Love the shoes\n",
    "Loved how they felt while squatting, very stable and great for allowing me to hit depth. Definitely recommend for people with lack of ankle mobility. My biggest gripe and why it isn't 5 stars is that the shoes are super narrow. I don't have wide feet and these are still tight enough to cause a bit of discomfort towards the end of my lifting session.\n",
    "I'm on my feet all day, and I have tried many different brands of expensive shoes, including Dansko, MBT, Nike air max, Timberland etc. None of those brands are as comfortable as my work Crocs! I love them, and bought several extra pairs  to have as back-ups. They are so comfortable, and they require no break in period. They look good with slacks (business casual) or jeans, and they come in several colors. I have them in three different colors, and use them all regularly. I did have to order a size up, I usually wear a 7 1/2 and had to get the 8, which fits perfectly. The other plus is that they cost a fraction of what I paid for some of these other brands! Love, love, love these shoes!\n",
    "Stretched out the first time I wore them. Could not return, so they were no use to me.\n",
    "I was disappointed in the fit and it is impossible to keep the shoes on my feet when I am walking.  I love Finn shoes- this is my second pair and the styling and quality are very good.  However, with shoes - it is all about fit!  The arch support on these is not nearly as good as my prior pair of Finn.  I love that the straps (both) are adjustable but I still can't keep them on my feet when I am walking.  I really needed a pair of sandals that I could wear to work and make the walk into work comfortably.  These don't work.  I'm basically using them as house shoes to wear around the house.  I apparently need a higher heel or a back strap in order to walk comfortably and keep the shoes on my feet.\n",
    "Comfortable and Stylish but A Little Small. I'd say go one size bigger than your usual shoe.\n",
    "nice light-weight golf shoe - no problem walking 18 holes\n",
    "The main reason I purchased these insoles is to help with my metatarsalagia from running. They are very cushion-y and have allowed me to run with no pain. One drawback is that they are super thick, especially in the arch to heal. I would have preferred to have more cushion for the ball of my foot and less in the arch/heel.<br /><br />That being said, I'm running comfortably again and will be able to complete the half marathon I'm training for, so that's a huge plus!\n",
    "These sneakers provide excellent comfort to my soles! Two thumbs up!\n",
    "Since I got these for $14.99 I have to say I got an incredible bargain and they're very comfortable.\n",
    "Very nice for the price.  As pictured and fast delivery\n",
    "Yeah--I love this bag.  Only gave it a 4--which is somewhat unfair, since these are MY issues and it is described online perfectly:  it's a little (pun unintended) too small.  Also, I like everything about the design EXCEPT a deeper pocket in back would be better & an open pocket in front in addition to the 2 zippered pockets.<br />I had a leather bag exactly as described above.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to find another!\n",
    "super cute, sadly they were not comfortable for me. But I have foot problems and the wedge put just enough pressure on the ball of my foot that I couldn't keep them. They are really nice, I wish I could have kept them.\n",
    "The color was Black instead of Navy. Otherwise everything was as expected.\n",
    "I wish that they were offered in other colors.  I would buy them in all colors offered.\n",
    "I bought these boots about 4 months ago and recently decided to read some of the stuff other people said about them. I want to clear something up that ive read in some comments on the boots. These boots are fairly thick leather and have a long break in period if they hurt your feet thats just how its going to be for a little while the only advice i have to offer people with that problem is bet better insoles and you can ride out the stiffness and then realize these are very well priced. Only complaint is the massive price increase for large sizes i wear a 14 US or aka the 13 UK and paid 150 were someone with like a 9 US paid 80 when I bought them a while back. Notice in the picture all the creases those don't happen overnight so again just ride it out\n",
    "I love them but they were just too small so I gave them to a friend and ordered myself a larger pair.  The faux chinchilla is wonderful.\n",
    "Beatiful shoes!\n",
    "Versatile cross body and will fit more than you think.\n",
    "I lifeguarded throughout the summer and was scared to use my $200 pair of ray bans, I found these on Amazon and they were great for wear and tare purposes. By the end of the three months of wearing them throughout the day they had little scratches but they got the job done. The fact that they are polarized helped a lot. They are very light because they are made out of all plastic but I didn't mind, I knew that by the end of summer I would probably toss them.\n",
    "These are great in an arsenal of basic sneakers. They give a slim profile and are very cozy. The leather/suede upper is a great touch, but does not clean easily. These are a flatfooted shoe, so if you have problems with arch support you should definitely consider alternative footwear for daily out-and-about.<br /><br />Add to this that they are affordable. I wear them regularly Sp/Su/F and get about 2 years of wear which is above par as far as many sneakers go.\n",
    "The shoes fit as expected, and the only reason that I didn't post 5 stars is that they didn't seem to wear very well. What I mean is, after about the thrid time I wore them, on the right shoe, the glue began seperating from the toe. I didn't stub it or anything, and only wore these to the YMCA to excercise, but they just kind of started falling apart. The fifth time I wore them, one of the loops on the heel came off. They were shipped quickly and the packaging was right for the item enclosed.\n",
    "My daughter has 3 pairs.  When I visited her I tried them out and went home and ordered my own.  I love them.  Comfortable, stylish and nothing between the toes!!!\n",
    "I haven't taken these into the water just yet, but wanted to comment on the size for others who are looking. I normally wear a U.S. women's size 7.5 to 8 in shoes. Assuming I would want a snug fit for water shoes I sized down to the 7s in these and they were very loose which would have caused a lot of drag and slipping walking on river beds and such. I received the 6 today and they feel like a perfect fit, snug enough that I am hopeful they'll maintain this comfort when wet. These are shown as women's sizes, but as I wear a 6 in men's athletic shoes, I'd suggest just buying whatever your men's equivalent size would be...<br /><br />I will try to update once I wear these out but so far I'm pleased now that I have found the right fit.\n",
    "Excellent product!  Arrived  on time\n",
    "From my granddaughter's wish list; as far as I know, she loves them and wears them all the time.\n",
    "Very cute shoes, however, they dug into my heels after a couple of hours.\n",
    "These are very cute shoes and are very comfortable for the most part. They run slightly narrow but not too uncomfortably so. The insole is nice and soft and the rest of the shoe is well constructed. The only reason for 4 stars (rather than 5) is that the heel is somewhat abrasive, like many shoes. This is an easy fix with a couple of small band-aids or socks that come up high enough in the back.\n",
    "These are the most comfortable sandals I own and I love the purple/pink color! I usually wear a size 7.5 in nike athletic shoes, since sandals normally run a bit smaller than athletic shoes I ordered a size 7 in women's and they fit perfect. They are slightly wider than thong sandals but they were not too wide and I think the slightly bigger width adds to the comfort. I normally don't like slide sandals because they fall off my feet but these are made of a special rubber and they kind of stick to your foot so they don't fall off easily. The rubber sole on these feel like those anti fatigue kitchen mats, I think they are much more comfortable than the memory foam sandals nike makes. The only reason I rated these 4 instead of 5 stars was the price. I know the purple/pink color is hard to find but these shoes really shouldn't cost over $30 and the ones I bought were $56 so they were overpriced. You can get the black color for $30 at most stores, however I have only been able to find them in mens sizes. For reference I wear a size 7 in womens but when I ordered the black pair I wore a size 6 in mens (even though the chart said I should get a 5). Would I buy these again for $56, probably not, but I really wanted the purple/pink color and they were a splurge. I still love these shoes though and they are exceptionally comfortable, you won't be disapointed!\n",
    "Fit well, great for mowing grass on sunny days.\n",
    "It's a tiny little metal shoe horn. I guess it's cheaper to make these out of metal. I think it's better to get a plastic one, though. There is no reason to make this out of metal. If you're worried about a plastic one snapping then you've got bigger issues.<br /><br />Covered in black paint. The edges seem smooth. Haven't had any problems with jagged edges catching on my socks.\n",
    "Good product... good frame and glass but I didn't like how it looked on me.\n",
    "Well, I have a problem, the item was smaller than expected. I would like to know if there's a way to make a change because they are really small.<br />If you can help me I would really appreciate, my email is japf1492@gmail.com Thank you so much.\n",
    "Shoe as expected\n",
    "Can't find these glasses anywhere anymore.<br /> Love pocket clip\n",
    "Awesome shoe.  I'm getting a lot of compliments on them too.\n",
    "The shoes ran small and the clasp was broken when it arrived. Unfortunately I didn't realize it was broken until I had already worn them. I'm very disappointed.\n",
    "Son asked for these to be ordered to use while in military to train. Shoes held up well and gave good support during ten weeks of training, .\n",
    "I like these shoes and would buy again, but the arch support should be better, hence 4 out of 5\n",
    "Thank you !\n",
    "Perfect\n",
    "Bought these and once they were delivered put them on immediately.  They are a marvelous pair of Fivefingers! Soft leather gives this pair an understated classic look when compared to normal fivefingers sporty get noticed colors.  I use these for extensive travel. Fit is perfect for average size 12.5 foot size,  quality of materials great, quality of workmanship is there too.  I WISH I DID BUY MORE OF THESE.\n",
    "Very cute, but large on my 14mo. She's in the 50% for height and weight, so average sized baby, but these won't fit her for awhile.\n",
    "The shoes are very comfortable however the sizing, according to my foot doctor, runs a bit small.  She pointed out how close the toes are resting at the very end of the insert.\n",
    "Love these\n",
    "I love these shoes but I got the wrong size\n",
    "These fit as expected and are great for any kiddo with a wide foot!\n",
    "Love them\n",
    "Initially they were pretty tight, second time I wore them they seemed to have stretched out, so much so that I am concerned after repeated wearing they would become way to big. Also, after wearing them for over an hour in the house, my feet began to sweat quite a bit. As much as I like them, the style and color and I really like Merrell shoes, I'm afraid I am going to return them because of the sweaty feet and fear of after complete break in I would walk right out of them.\n",
    "There is always the stigma of purchasing shoes online that they will never fit perfectly. Well luckily enough I was able to try these shoes on at the store and get the correct fit that I liked. They came in 3 days above schedule and did what shoes do . Only wish I got them in a different color\n",
    "Nice shoes, comfortable!\n",
    "Beautiful and incredibly comfortable! Wore the for over 16 hours on a very busy day with lots of walking involved and my feet were not hurting at all by the end of the day.\n",
    "super cute! love!\n",
    "The first time I put them on the zipper broke. Until now I couldn't remember where I bought them.  A total loss of my money.  No more Jessica Simpson for me!!  Thank you for nothing  Nancy Ffrench  Yes it is Ffrench with a double f\n",
    "Daughter very pleased with these boots.  Seem well made.  Nice rugged bottoms.\n",
    "High end tri-fold wallet, with bill compartment, coin pouch, many card slots and a window pocket. This stylishly designed wallet is perfect for any one.  This luxury wallet is made of genuine cow leather and the quality is great.\n",
    "These were for my 11 year old 'princess'.  She LOVES anything with sparkles & heels!!  So these were a huge hit with her.  She wears them EVERYWHERE and has had adults wish they could get them in their size!\n",
    "Super cute and comfy. Until they have now failed. With a huge open crack in them where the foot bends. Right shoe now useless. I am so disappointed that I can not return for refund. Vendor should take the hit on these, not me. They did not even last the full season I bought them for.\n",
    "I uv it\n",
    "First of all I order the shoe in black. All identifications (labeling on box) indicated that the box contained the correct shoe. Unfortunately, upon opening the box I found a navy blue/white mixed shoe. Once over my anger, I tried the shoes on, they were very comfortable. I wear them all day and my feet does not burn or hurt. I have ordered another pair, hopefully they will be black as I requested.\n",
    "Love these shoes. They're very comfortable and they are extremely breathable which is important when you're trying to stay cool in the hot summer months.\n",
    "I want to send them back.\n",
    "Size is perfect and Amazon maintain the delivery schedule.\n",
    "I love these shoes! They are exactly as they appear in the picture and are comfortable! I normally wear an 8.5 and ordered that size but they run a tad large. They will be perfect in the fall/winter with thick socks. I was happy with them and was impressed at how fast I received them after placing my order.\n",
    "Easy Spirit is my go-to sneaker. They had discontinued the style I preferred but these are a perfect replacement. I have a heel spur and trouble with foot cramps with most shoes but these are comfortable and do not cause me a bit of problem. Relatively inexpensive for a sneaker but I'll be buying another set soon because they are perfect for me.\n",
    "The shoes fit great and are really comfortable!\n",
    "just great.\n",
    "The sole broke in one shift. And by broke I mean I had a chunk fall off. Service was not very nice about it either\n",
    "June just a smidge small  compared to normal addidas but not enough to go up a size. Loom amazing, even the tread is retro. My new favorite shoe.\n",
    "I love the style of these sunglasses, but they are not, as described above, polarized.  They failed every test of polarization.  But if you don't care about this anti-glare technology -- or don't want it since it makes it difficult to look at electronic screens such as GPS devices and cell phones -- then these might be for you.  Even though they have that retro style, they are modern enough to look chic.  They have floating silicone nose pads for comfort; thin gold-tones wire rims on the bottom of the lenses; and a plastic tortoise shell frame top that extends into the arms as well.  These sit comfortably on my face without sliding down my nose.  Besides the lack of polarization, the only thing I'm not wild about is the style of the bridge -- the gold-tone design looks a little cheap, much more so than the rest of the glasses.  For the current price of $20, these are priced right and are a great choice for the style.  Note:  I received a free sample for review.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\n",
    "It not only hurt my feet, but the &quot;design&quot; on the front of one was more pronounced than on the other.\n",
    "My husband is a size 11.5 but after reading the reviews - it says to order 2 sizes up or they become uncomfortable on the heel part. I ordered 13 and were too big! No problem with return. The sz 12 fit better.\n",
    "These really hurt my feet. Angled so your foot crams into the front. Gave me a blister.\n",
    "Love them\n",
    "very comfortable\n",
    "well, tecnically, my wife loves them. She's a life-long Birkie fan, and these sandals did not disappoint.\n",
    "LOVE LOVE LOVE !!!!!\n",
    "Love these shoes, much more comfortable than others I have tried\n",
    "I don't wear anything else!!  They are light weight and a great rose color.. I ski and swim in them with no problems!  The lenses are sooo clear!\n",
    "perfect color for my work uniform, comfy and clean. Might buy more.\n",
    "I love this bag!!!!  Great tote for work and also Alabama roll tide roll!!!\n",
    "These shoes were everything that I have come to expect from a Rockport product.\n",
    "The color is odd- more purple than blue. My son said he could not wear.<br />Sent back and paid $15 for shipping. So much for Prime\n",
    "Gave me sores just below my Achilles tendon.  I hope I can wear them once they heal!!\n",
    "So I have bad heel spurs in both my feet so I cant wear a lot of shoes if they dont offer good arch support. I love Fila shoes and saw these and bought them. Its always a risk for me. I got them and wore them to walk around the mall to try them out. They are actually amazing. The sole and arch support are perfect. It felt like I was walking on air and I had no issue wearing them the entire day. I am very happy with them because I never get to wear the shoes that are comfortable and I love how they look. These are the only exception. Oh did I mention they are affordable?\n",
    "I love them.\n",
    "I've been trying to find a Travelon or Travelon-like bag for a while but have been having a hard time with sizing (not too big and not too small).  This does the trick.  Right now, I have an iPad mini, Vera Bradley wallet and makeup bag, small notebook, iPhone 6s (in a thin case), keys, work ID, flash drive and many other bits and pieces and everything fits nicely. I've read other reviews, on other sites, complaining about the short handle and slightly smaller opening.  I'm a 5', full sized gal and the short handle fits well over my arms.  The cross body strap, fully open, had the bag knocking against my shin. So I know I'm going to be able to wear it, comfortably, with a coat.  I wanted to get away from the &#34;all black bag&#34; habit, so I tried the blue.  It's actually a nice neutral color.  Well made, good size, RFID protection, ample storage and a crazy great price on Amazon.  Works for me!\n",
    "slim than i expected<br />got it on time\n",
    "LOVE LOVE LOVE - a lot brighter then I normally wear but absolutely love these shoes!\n",
    "Used for my corssfit training. Fits well for my 9.5 us and light enough to do box jumps and rope climbs\n",
    "I came home form a week in the boundary waters, portaging over the granite rocks, gravel, in and out of the canoe, up and over hills, climbing small waterfalls, and the shoes were great........came home and bought a second pair.\n",
    "Love it..\n",
    "I was hoping for a nice pair of slippers I could wear around my home. What I got was something so horrifically uncomfortable that I decided that I'd rather go barefoot. After taking one step in them, I put the slippers back in the box and returned them.\n",
    "My daughter loves them!\n",
    "First of all these are NOT $65 sandals. I'm glad I got them on sale for $34 but I still wish I never bought them. I bought them for the arch support, which it has, but there are other things about the sandals that completely negate the whole arch support thing and make them really uncomfortable. The foot bed material feels nice and soft but the entire outer edge of the sandal comes up almost like it's forming a cup so that your toes don't lay flat. Instead they are forced upward in a weird position so that the rest of the foot sloped downward into the cupped part and my foot suctions into it as I walk. It's annoying and weird. The raised edge makes sense on most of the sandal except for the toes. I don't really get it. They should lay flat because it would make the arch support do what it's supposed to do. Also the strap that goes between the toes is very hard and hurts my toes. I expected a little better construction for the original $65 price. I guess $34 seems about right if they were more comfortable. My feet always hurt as it is but these make them feel worse. I really wanted to like them. I never leave reviews but I just had to with these.\n",
    "I love these sandals. I liked them so much I bought a second pair. The heel is just right, the craftsmanship and materials what I expected for the price. They're a little bit wide for my narrow foot but they make up for it in style and quality. Many compliments.\n",
    "I love this shoe...Will be buying another pair in 3 months. Comfortable and Awesome!\n",
    "These are fine. The frames are flexible, which is different but nice. I like that they're polarized. They're cute. They came packaged well and in a bag so the lenses were in perfect condition.<br /><br />I think they run pretty large. I was disappointed in their sizing. They fit me pretty well. And yes, I have a petite face, but I'm still an adult.  These were massive on my 3.5yo.\n",
    "Will not purchase because of the white top stitching--detracts from an otherwise appealing a sandal!\n",
    "then design and durability is great. too cheap for its quality.\n",
    "Majority of my shoes are Cole Haan. These Slip-ons require some softening of the top, back ankle of the shoe. Wearing these with socks looks ridiculous. I did not think about getting cuts on the back of my ankles. The Ivory color is what I have. You may be very disappointed if these get dirty. The material is cloth/linen which is a bit difficult to clean dark marks off a light colored shoe.\n",
    "While these shoes are super cute and I adore the print, they are a bit narrow for my wider feet. I can only really wear them to work (a desk job) but I  do get a TON of compliments on them when I do. So I guess it evens out!\n",
    "Way too big!!\n",
    "These boots are good for my wide feet (I ordered a 6.5 wide) and that is my normal size.  I have problems with bunions but the leather is soft and after a few wearings they conformed to the bunions on my feet.  My arches have fallen so I need a good supportive shoe/boot and these have great arch support!\n",
    "I recommend excellent product . All very good\n",
    "This shoes are just perfect. Casual style Wich I love. Beautiful brown color. Very good quality. Bought them for fall season. So excited! My size is 8,5, i ordered my size, but now thinking that I should order 1 size up.\n",
    "I live in the country and it's nice to easily kick these off at the door.\n",
    "Bought for my son first day at school. It's practical, easy and very comfortable since he's so active.\n",
    "so very comfortable!\n",
    "I LOVE THIS PURSE GREAT QUALITY\n",
    "Love it\n",
    "They do help!\n",
    "My boyfriend loved them!\n",
    "Loved It!!!\n",
    "The perfect show for my lifestyle.\n",
    "Gorgeous shoes fit wonderfully! I do not have skinny calves 14.5 and they are fine!\n",
    "Love them fit like a glove very comfortable\n",
    "I thought their would be fur throughout the inside of the boot but it ended at the ankle. I was expecting them to be warmer but overall good boot.\n",
    "Don't put anything on the inside pockets. The magnetic clasps don't hold\n",
    "I was really disappointed when these shoes did not fit. I am a size 10...in every shoe I own....and these had my toes crammed up against the front of the shoe. I was going to take them to Disney World and was so disappointed that I could not walk around my living room without discomfort, much less a day at the Park. If you are able to order a half size larger than what you normally wear, that is the way to go, in my opinion. They are adorable in every way and would probably be very supportive and cushioned, if worn in the right size.\n",
    "O love it\n",
    "Would have given another star but the lighter color on the sole isn't my preference. I prefer darker since they get dirty quickly.\n",
    "These are my first Crocs, but they won't be my last.  I usually wear a 9W and these were a 10.  At first, they were too big (ie, long), but soon, the extra room was shifted to account for my wide food.  I know they're supposed to be anti-microbial, so I'm anxious to see if my feet will stink or not (they always used to before I started wearing only leather shoes).  My husband is SUPER picky about shoes' appearance and even HE likes them.  Unfortunately there are 2 holes on the arch of each shoe.  I'm guessing they are for ventilation.  Without them, they would be perfect for walking in the rain, or puddles or mud.  Sure wish I'd had these when I was riding buses to get to work.\n",
    "this are for my nephew, he runs track in high school. he said these fit good and the spikes are the right size. the color is cool. and they come in a lot of colors. he would buy more.\n",
    "I've used these in the gym, for hiking, and for everyday use.<br /><br />They're built to last and are rather comfortable. Highly recommend for anyone looking for an all around shoe.\n",
    "Good\n",
    "Had to Return, unable to wear, they run wide. Not for a narrow foot.\n",
    "i love it, its so cute, gives you an Indian feel\n",
    "Brother loved it\n",
    "Very suitable\n",
    "Attractive black bag. Nice size when a wristlet is too small. I would feel comfortable gifting this.\n",
    "Love these!  so cute, I have gotten so many compliments on them...good quality, great purchase!\n",
    "My son played in one football game with these shoes and they began to fall apart.  The soles/cleats started separating from the shoe in the heel area during the first game.  The trainers had to tape the soles/cleats to help prevent additional separation and injury prior to the second game.  If cleats separate during play it could lead to a serious injury.  Stay away from these shoes.\n",
    "Too large. Does not cut down to a 7W or fit in my Propet shoe like it said it would.<br /><br />They don't cut down well on the sides, so they don't fit width-wise in my sneakers. They're also too thick for my Propet Mary-Janes, so in the end they were not what I wanted. I realized that the insoles I need are not very typical, but I was hoping these would work....<br /><br />It was a couple hours before it gave me blisters on the top of my foot. It was too tall, so my foot rubbed bad against the top of my shoe.<br /><br />When I finally got it in my shoe, the arch was in the wrong place. So maybe it would have given me good arch support if they were in the right place?\n",
    "These flip-flops are extremely comfortable and look cute with shorts, skirts, dresses, or jeans.\n",
    "The fit was very good and comfortable.\n",
    "They came fast and the quality was great, however they did not come with the ankle buckles, and i was very upset.\n",
    "I am going to note that these are my daughters so I cant give a good review.\n",
    "Really like the shoes good quality.  Have added insole for example training comfort and added growth.inside of shoe lined well no sharp seams.very soft soles.\n",
    "fits perfectly\n",
    "It is very nice but the size was a little bit big.\n",
    "So so\n",
    "Ok I love the shoes but I can only look at it because it can't fit. What is my normal size that I purchase for other shoes seem not to be the standard size as expected that really disappointing since I was waiting enjoy this product which is now a waste. Really disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
    "I like the look of it. I'm 5'1&#34; and it comes down to my knees. I tried to put a knot, but then it was to small to go over my head and shoulder.\n",
    "It's very beautiful and has enough space to put everything in.\n",
    "Excelente...\n",
    "If you are looking for comfort shoes, these are the ones. Pretty, cozy, and comfort are what I can say about these clogs. I like the pattern of the upper which is a combination of two different textures in two different red tones, very subtle, yet pretty. They would be a great to wear in autumn and winter! You would feel warmed up instantly! I don't normally wear clogs because I thought they were for generations of my mom and beyond, but I started to change my mind after trying these on =) My feet feel phenomenal in them. The insoles are super cushioned. So is the lining of the shoes.<br /><br />For the fit, they run mall (as in narrow and short) for wide feet. I got a pair in 8M/W (width: 3-3/8&#34; to 3.5&#34;, length: 9.5&#34;; I didn't exactly understand what that sizing system meant when it had both M and W in it!); and they fit my wide feet very perfectly. I have wide feet but slender heels; and I usually wear 7.5M in closed-toe shoes and 8M-9M in boots (depending on the brands and designs). The long-vamp design covers most of the upper part of my feet, which makes it a little challenging to put them on. However, my feet do not slip out of these shoes while walking. As a result, I'd suggested that if you have wide feet, definitely go at least 1 size up. If you have narrow feet, I would recommend you go with your true clog size.\n",
    "Somewhat narrow.\n",
    "These are her favorite boots by far and they are super cute. I did notice some scuffing on the toes after about three days but in all fairness she was playing on blacktop at school.  These boots would definitely be best for dress and not play. But try telling that to a seven-year-old with a boot addiction!\n",
    "My wife has shoe fitting problems and it is not the boot. The use is for costuming and it works well for the time she wears them.\n",
    "Slippers fell apart in a few days and stretched out so bad my feet were slipping.  The company refunded with no problems.\n",
    "I have worn Ariat paddock boots for a long time. This Ariat hiking boot is so much more comfortable, the sole support is really good. Great for all day walking.\n",
    "Good product\n",
    "Smaller than my actual size\n",
    "Good\n",
    "I'm fall in love on it! Soft leather shoes. Very comfortable, even if you have to walk all day.\n",
    "They re good flip-flops. Pretty durable too. My last pair lasted me about 5 years.\n",
    "great shoe! many compliments! fit as expected!!! I love them!!\n",
    "These are my son's favorite shoes, we try to get Fallen every time.\n",
    "the color is not what it look in the picture, to pale,\n",
    "Excellent!\n",
    "Exceptional shoes in comfort and style.\n",
    "I've had this shoe before and they fit great.\n",
    "I love this case\n",
    "I could stand and walk for days in these shoes. Great for brisk waking, work, dancing... You name it!  I have bad bunion pain and very low insteps and these easily accommodate custom orthotics too. I order a size down and they always fit.\n",
    "Delivery was quick and there were absolutely now problems !\n",
    "I wear between a 7 and a 7.5 but usually but go smaller on heels and larger on boots. These are a little snug, but I don't mind that as I don't like it when they are too big and keep slipping off my heels. The color and shoes are really pretty and will wear well to church and work. Glad I purchased.\n",
    "GREAT, SNUGGLY FIT, THANKS SO MUCH !!!!\n",
    "very good shoes. the color is more blue than gray\n",
    "Perfect ~\n",
    "Very bright red. Lot's of compliments.\n",
    "1st Glance: Packaging & instructions were great and provided value. Easy to follow along and replace lenses and even came with a new pouch for my shades.  One strange thing I noticed and maybe it was just me. When walking with the sun in my face I started to get a slight headache or a dull pain behind my eyes.  I'm not sure if the sun was too bright for this specific polarization but it reminded me of wearing an incorrect prescription of glasses.  Once sitting and reading at the pool, I no longer noticed this issue.<br /><br />4 Weeks In: Starting to notice some a whole bunch of tiny spec marks out of the front of the lenses. I am not noticing a loss in the quality of my vision but from up close they do not look like they did when I purchase these. I clean these with a cleaning kit from Sun Glass hut (where I purchased my other Oakley's).  I haven't seen this isse with my other sunglasses which i've had for a few months longer.\n",
    "Love these shoes\n",
    "I wear size 15 in other shoes, including NB, but the NB 15s and even 16s were too small.\n",
    "Just okay.  Worth the money if you only golf once and a while.  Not waterproof, but they are good shoes for an amateur golfer.\n",
    "Always like these shoes!!\n",
    "Great shoe at a great price!\n",
    "These are great for my work shoes. I wear an 11 and the XL fit perfectly. The smell of the wood is amazing and leaves my shoes fresh and in great shape. Thanks.\n",
    "SInce they discontinued my favorite Ultra Sendor this is next best thing.\n",
    "Great price for these.\n",
    "These shoes feel really good in my feet. The only thing is that while I was breaking them, it seems like they stretched a lot. Before they stretched they were almost perfect. I bought a size smaller of these shoes from a different company & they were way too small. These shoes are great. They just don't quite fit like my Dansko's do.\n",
    "Love this style. Fit great and are very comfortable.\n",
    "Almost three sizes too small!\n",
    "These running shoes are terrific and I am very pleased with the support. Asides is a good brand.\n",
    "Love the shoe!  Have worn it for years. Very durable and comfortable!  Wouldn't wear anything else to play pickleball!\n",
    "Awesome shoes... My favorite Cole Haan´s!! You will never regret to buy them!!\n",
    "Great looking shoes and they fit well.  My only remorse it that the buckles are a pain in the back-side to get on and off.\n",
    "The shoe is beautiful but I ordered a size 7M and a size 10 was delivered instead.\n",
    "The shoes were cute and stylish, but the tops were too tight/narrow.  I couldn't squeeze my average-width feet into them, nor would the material stretch very easily, so I had to return them.\n",
    "VERY CUTE AND GREAT QUALITY\n",
    "Small\n",
    "Cute! Fits just slightly smaller than the other three pairs in the same size off Amazon. All the pairs were the same size and fit as expected but these fit just slightly smaller and my foot hits close to the back edge. With that said, cute cute cute! They also seem to be nice quality.. It will be interesting to see if the Rhinestones fall out of the bottom rim over time with use or collect dirt in between. I guess time will tell, for now I am happy!\n",
    "Great purchase fast delivery time.. Very satisfied with my purchase\n",
    "I have Morgan-nueroma in my left foot and had to give up shallow water aerobics because of the pain. I tried wearing a regular pair of sneakers in the pool but they were completely in appropriate for that use as they soaked up the water like a sponge. I also tried a regular pair of water shoes but there was no support. These Merrell Men's Water shoes however are working out great and now I am able to go back to the classes that I'm able to do with my bad back.I thought they were a little pricey but in the end well worth it.\n",
    "Nice fit.\n",
    "My daughter loves them.  They look really cute with her leggings and seem to keep her little feet warm in the winter.\n",
    "I am giving these boots a 4 even though I am sending  them back. The quality is great and it really is a beautiful boot which is why I am rating it as I am. However,  I have short (5'2&#34;) and muscular legs (14&#34;) but these boots are too wide for my legs. They look like rain galoshes which is not at all cute. I am between a 7.5 and 7 shoe size and ordered the 7 and felt the boots were too long on my foot as well. Sending these back...perhaps I'll try the non-wide calf version in a 6.5? The boot hunt continues.\n",
    "The bag looks as pictured, but you have to put the strap in the front yourself. A bit annoying.\n",
    "This is a going to the store shoe. It didn't last 2 months at work before the sole started falling off. Thank goodness they were on sale.\n",
    "This is the third pair of Keen shoes that I have purchased and they are great. I was a little apprehensive about buying them online but after reading the reviews and considering the input from multiple reviewers I went ahead and ordered the shoes. I did order them a half size larger than I normally wear and they fit perfectly.\n",
    "These are super cute flats, I love the pewter color!  They don't have much for arch support, but they are flats after all and I didn't expect much to begin with.. However for the price and the look, I will still be happy!\n",
    "This boot is great holds up against chemicalss and it is the most waterproof work boot I have tried, and fits so very comfortable. Glad I finally found this boot\n",
    "thank you\n",
    "While I liked the previous model better, this seems to be a suitable replacement, but not an upgrade or improvement....Why do shoe companies keep changing the models? Sometimes the one you have is great and doesn't need to be tweaked.\n",
    "I got these for my husband and he loves them.  They are amazingly comfortable.\n",
    "Wore these to WLC without having broken them in but that wasn't a problem.  I did get a few blisters but they seemed minimal compared to what I've experienced from GI boots besides my feet weren't at all conditioned and I expected a few foot issues from long road marches.  These babies are light and were a dream doing land nav.  For those who like to do an airborne shuffle or slow jog when doing land nav or when rucking, these are on point.  I usually wear a 7 1/2 but sized up to an 8 based on other reviews and they fit perfectly.\n",
    "There really isn't a lot of support for running. Even for long walks I had to put an insert in for more support. Pro's- they're super light, awesome grip and no need to break them in much. Also they're really cute!\n",
    "I wear these only for aerobics classes. I replaced the insole with an orthotic since it didn't have the arch support I need for a Morton's neuroma. Toe space is a bit cramped. I went a half size larger than my usual Skechers but for exercising, I could have used another half size up. A good but not great shoe compared to other Skechers I have owned.\n",
    "I have to say, the reason I bought these was because I am a huge Duchess of Cambridge fan and she has these.  Having said that, if I didn't like them, I would have returned them....but I love them!  They fold up small and have a little case that can fit in a small purse.  They aren't polarized, but they block out the sun pretty good.\n",
    "Was pleasantly surprised as to how comfortable these are!  Great value for the price.\n",
    "I'm usually an 8-1/2 in American brands but in this shoe I would have to be a 9-1/2 which is the size I buy in European brands.<br />Overall I like the look and feel of the shoe but it's hard to comment since the size is so off.\n",
    "I had to return these as I'd ordered an 8 C and they were definitely not a wide shoe, nor properly fitting lengthwise.  Pretty disappointing.  The uppers were a little cheap looking, which I could let go for a less than $40 shoe, but the soles were cheap and slippery with no traction.  I had them on my feet for about 45 seconds before I sighed and put them back in the box.\n",
    "Great shoe.  I normally wear 8.5 - 9 shoes.  I wish I had gone for size 9 but the 8.5 fits fine as well.  As mentioned in another review, go for the larger of the sizes if you're between sizes.  I use these shoes for mountain biking and the grip is amazing!\n",
    "I purchased this shoe to replace an old Naturalizer slip on that i loved but had finally worn out. I ordered the same size (wide) as my old shoe, but this Naturalizer shoe was both shorter and narrower and too tight for me. I was also surprised at the lack of arch support in this shoe. It seemed like it would be a comfortable shoe for someone with smaller feet and who doesn't need much arch support.\n",
    "Within one wearing, the shoes molded to my feet and felt great.  By the second time, I could walk for hours.\n",
    "This is my second pair of these. Enough said!\n",
    "Love them\n",
    "Very pleased and will purchase in other colors.\n",
    "The shoes are super cute but unfortunately, they are almost 2 sizes too big and way too wide. Had to return them and get different ones.\n",
    "Very good shoe at a bargain price.  I really enjoyed the quick delivery.  Quality of the shoe is as expected - very good ankle support, comfortable and light - excellent for tennis.\n",
    "I love these... Planning to order another pair!!\n",
    "Excellent. I received more than expected for the price.  In addition to the sunglasses themselves, they came in a hard case with a folded soft case as an option and a few other extra accessories.\n",
    "I love this style of Keen so much that I bought a black pair in addition to the brown pair I have. Comfortable and functional yet stylish. I get many compliments on them. Since they are closed toe, I can wear them on the job\n",
    "Great for by the ocean. My son loves them!\n",
    "Do yourself a favor and add these boots to your cart!!! You know you want to!!! I had always been a true size 7 in my adult life but since becoming pregnant, toting my son around for 9 months and now an additional 3 since he's been born, my feet have gotten super wide and none of my shoes seem to fit so I've sized up to 7.5/8. I thought to order a 7.5 in these but based on reviews stuck with the 7 (since they seem to run large) and crossed my fingers that they'd fit. Well they arrived this am and I am ecstatic!!! These are gorgeous and so supple and have room for even my thickest socks on these wide momma feet! The unlined leather does grip but with boots this gorgeous take a second to appreciate putting them on! I already can wait to order more from bed stu! I ordered the &#34;black lux&#34; and the color is exquisite! A brown boot overall with a lovely black wash. The photo does NOT do them justice and they were the cheapest color option! Score! I LOVE AMAZON!!!\n",
    "Im not one to generally write comments, or reviews but this piece deserves it. I am a Mom of two and I am constantly running around and carrying a million things. This piece is small, looks great and holds everything!\n",
    "I wear a 9.5 but could only find these in a 9. They fit fine. I really like these shoes. They are lightweight and very comfortable. I am used to heavier Keen shoes and am curious how these will hold up. I replaced the insoles but I do that for all of my shoes.\n",
    "Comfortable, light weight, good hiking shoe. Arrived in good condition and as promised. I'm happy\n",
    "Nice shoes. Very light, though. Good for the price.\n",
    "Very comfortable shoe. Loved the color, fit and wearability.\n",
    "I ordered silver and I rec'd pink fitflops. They do not fit the same as other size 7s I have ordered in the past!\n",
    "Love the roxy slip ons! Couldn't be happier with how they look. They tend to be a little wide for my feet, work better in the fall and winter with socks. Also not much for support, but perfect for me to wear to work/school when I'm wanting to wear something other than sneakers. Definitely not something I'd like to wear when I'm on my feet all day though.\n",
    "Let me start off by saying that I am a complete novice when it comes to buying shoes based solely for running. I found a recommendation online and made my decision based on that. I'm very pleased with my purchase and I will most likely continue to buy going forward.\n",
    "My husband loves these shoes! He lives in them! He will never buy another boot ever again!\n",
    "I have wide feet. These are not gonna work for me.\n",
    "For a medium width they are way to wide.  They would provide arch support is foot did not move around so loosely in the shoe.\n",
    "Perfect fit. The arrive date of my package wasn't until sept 11-25 and I received them faster than that. Very pleased with them.\n",
    "This was not my first pair of ASICS shoes.  I keep buying them because they are super comfortable and always fit.\n",
    "My son loves them. They were a bit tight for the first few days but a bit of breaking them in and they are good to go\n",
    "Super cute. I followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered 2 sizes too large - perfect!\n",
    "These were the best shoes for our son, before and definetely when he was learning to walk, they protect his feet in every way, but thin enough for him to feel different surfaces with his toe's in order to learn to walk, and they of course went with everything. love these shoes, and will be ordering more with my second son.\n",
    "They are very comfortable and since I'm on my feet all day that is a plus.\n",
    "Nice boot Insides are leather also\n",
    "Great boots, awesome colour (my favourite shade!) and so durable. I worked in them through rain and mud and they withstood it all! It was even good to hike in up a muddy hill because of the good tread on the bottom. Thank you!\n",
    "Pretty comfortable!\n",
    "The Naturalizer Women's Fryna Wedge Sandal are beautiful sandals. They are a little snug but being all leather I know they will stretch. I liked these sandals so much I also ordered them in Navy, very nice. I have worn Naturalizer shoes and sandals for quite a while and have always been happy with them. The sandals are leather, well made and comfortable, really couldn't ask for more.\n",
    "Cute bag, I have carried several times since I received it. The chain strap makes it different and cute\n",
    "These are absolutely adorable and she loves them.\n",
    "these are amazing! they don't feel cheap at all! they're very sturdy and look great!\n",
    "Really cute! I love that these shoes are stylish, plus they're practical. My 15 month old son can walk around, and play in these without any issues. I personally ordered them a little big, so he could wear them a little bit longer. Fast delivery. Product as described. Very cute! He seems to enjoy wearing these.\n",
    "My daughter loves these shoes.  It's all she wears at the hospital.  Even the patients tell her how cute they are.  She wears a size 9 in most shoes, but has found that the 9.5-10works best in Danskos.\n",
    "very pleased\n",
    "Love these shoes\n",
    "Fine\n",
    "Satisfied. With  everything  I ordered  no issues  with.  Anything.\n",
    "Great walking shoes !\n",
    "These were perfect! I was afraid they might be too big for my 3 year old, but they fit great all around! I believe they will still work for another year if not two! Definitely recommend this product!\n",
    "Looks great , fit great, this is a excellent shoe. I love Steve Madden shoes. The wife likes them to and that's always a plus.\n",
    "I.ve been  a Keen client/user for 10years and as  allways I am very happy with the product. Keep up the good work and the excellent designs..\n",
    "Have not worn them for a long period of time.  The most has been 3 hrs and so far no problem.\n",
    "Clear fits well<br />Nice product\n",
    "Love it\n",
    "great shoe but much too heavy for me.\n",
    "These shoes are cute and I felt like they fit the way they were supposed to.<br />But as stated in another review the product came missing some rhinestones. As seen in the photos.\n",
    "Perfect love them\n",
    "Legs and lower back definitely feel a lot better, but the shoe could use more padding in general. Support is great, but after a while it feels like walking on concrete at the ball and heel. It is possible that its because I am heavy.\n",
    "WILL BE ORDERING THESE AGAIN:  ONLY WISH THAT THE SIZE I ORDERED CAME IN OTHER COLORS.\n",
    "Bought for my two sons and they love them! Better than even the picture , timberlands or as my sons say &#34;timbs&#34; are awesome.\n",
    "this was a gift that was given to someone else\n",
    "Beautiful loafer.\n",
    "Love it!\n",
    "great baby shoes\n",
    "Love these shoes. I find them very comfortable.\n",
    "I had to give them to my daughter since they run large for the size.  Nice slippers but buy a smaller size.\n",
    "Better than I thought, turned around and ordered two more pairs.\n",
    "love these shoes\n",
    "Artsy Classic\n",
    "Everything about this flip flop is great!  Keep in mind if these get wet, they may go...slosh...slosh..slosh.  Not a biggie for me.\n",
    "A little stiff out of the box but they should break in nicely. I bought these shoes for use in my hospital job. I ScotchGuarded them and  hope that It will keep them white.\n",
    "Who knew?  I love these shoes. They're comfortable, they give good support, they're light.  I'd buy them again, if they were offered.\n",
    "Great fit, very comfortable and great looking for the asked price. Very very satisfied.\n",
    ":o]\n",
    "Love these. I always get a set of gel insoles when ever I get a new pair gym shoes.\n",
    "Great show for the price\n",
    "Super comfortable--a bit flip-floppy for real walking but perfect around house and yard.\n",
    "Cheap material and it smells like gasoline. Its pleather and falls apart. I guess you get what you pay for. Also, on the shoe box it says this product can not be sold in California because it says the chemicals in the material may cause cancer. Ive worn them too much to return and threw away the box.\n",
    "I waited for these shoes for almost 3 weeks. I was disappointed to see they looked almost nothing like the ones in the picture. The heel isn't 3-4 inches like it says, more like barely 2 inches. The strap is halfway broken. The buckle doesn't fit because the strap was made very horribly. I gave it 2 stars because they got to me before the time I was told. Besides that? Very disappointed.\n",
    "Finding the right fit for these shoes can be difficult because they use European sizing. The easiest conversion can be found directly on the Vibram website.<br /><br />That said, these came in properly sized. But getting accustomed to my first pair of Fivefingers natural shoes is taking some time. Ease into them a couple hours per day to avoid fatigue and blisters.\n",
    "Overall these are pretty decent around the house lounging shoes hahaha! They fit great and they are surprisingly durable for the price.\n",
    "these were new tags attached but smelled sooooo bad like it was in a moldy dirty factory, i recieved then the morning of going to splish splash so i wore them and the insoles kept sliding and unstuck from the shoe and started rolling up on the arch of my foot! I wripped them off n went barefoot the rest of the day\n",
    "This is just what I needed. I am happy with it.\n",
    "Side of shoe coming apart after 1 month. First time purchasing hush puppies. I would not buy again. I tried to return to company and they would by replace item. Poor customer service. I would not recommend product.\n",
    "Terrific!\n",
    "Really nice shoes really good price but they are a little too big\n",
    "Cute as a fashion accessory.\n",
    "Needs buy covr for back n front so wont rub skin off.but once thats done.i loved it more\n",
    "The shoes were very comfortable in all other regards, except for being slightly too short, enough to be uncomfortable after a while. I was using thick woolen socks and a I just changed these to normal socks and they fit just fine. Aside from that, everything was good. In the future I would probably have gotten a half a size bigger.\n",
    "But it wear nice.\n",
    "Love these! Hunted all over for them!\n",
    "It creates hot spots on your foot. It's not very confortable. It needs a break in period I guess but it feel bad on the foot. I like that it's light and fits well(size was just right). The lining on the inside is very lumpy so it creates pressure points or hot spots on top of your foot. I had more confortable wolverines in the passed but this one is not up to par  to what I expected. Only time will tell if it will get more confortable.\n",
    "Returned for a larger size.  Run small.  Other than that, they were amazingly comfy for being on my feet for 10+ hours.  They are ugly as sin though, be prepared for some stares.\n",
    "Great s**t\n",
    "Great shoes\n",
    "very nice bag.\n",
    "Pretty cute. Held up with international traveling over 15 days and 8 plane trips as checked luggage. Still looks new.\n",
    "These are awesome, they look cool, make me run fast through the halls, and fix my pronation. Overall awesome. Plus they come in 13s\n",
    "They will be perfect once they are stretched out.  The insides are very comfy!\n",
    "Didn't last very long. My 11 year old wore the seams out within a few months..\n",
    "Same model that I wore out over several years playing golf, so even my 6.5 éee feet will be snug for a while, the shoes will expand enough to be just right within a month or two. Ps:  not expanding. I think they may have been marked wrong. I actually bought a pair from the manufacture as we'll and experiencing same condition. My 9 inch foot compares to a size 6 on international chart but I may need to move up to an 8 to get a comfortable fit.  I need to visit a store that has small sizes.\n",
    "Love these sandles and hope they never never change this style or discontinue them. Very sexy looking on the foot. I have several in different colors\n",
    "I haven't worn them enough to really know. I still need to get used to how high these platforms are. They are kind of hard to walk in but with enough practice it will become easy. They look amazing and they are very good quality. I like them a lot.\n",
    "Beautiful color and style.  I gave them to my daughter.  She loves thems.\n",
    "Just as expected\n",
    "I owned a pair of these shoes before and they quickly  became my favorite pair of work shoes,they lasted me well over a year. They were so nice I decided to buy 2 pair this time! Well after only 3 months they are starting to fall apart especially around the tip of the toe and the inside heal  area. Not sure why they are so different from the last pair, but once this second pair wears out in a few months I will not be buying another pair.\n",
    "Item as described, fit perfect, fast shipping\n",
    "very light and comfortable,good shoes. just run as you wish..\n",
    "So far...the best work shoes I have ever owned, and until  someone suggested I try this shoe,I have only used the brand I trusted most.<br />To say these are better than Red Wing Worx, is a compliment. As an added bonus ...these are half the price.\n",
    "Love them\n",
    "Size were too small and they were no quality\n",
    "Nice looking shoe.  Comfortable\n",
    "I have been looking for a good wide toe box shoe for years.  My toes naturally spread out to the point where my wife says I could fit another toe in between the ones I have.  I had researched different ways to lace up shoes to make them feel wider and it worked for a while until my foot would begin to blow out the sides of the shoes.  now insert the Altra One2.  This is the most comfortable running shoe I have ever worn!!!  I have had Asics, Nike, Addidas, Zoot, etc.  This one takes the win easily.  I was previously trading off running in Nike Free 3.0 and the Zoot Ultra Kiawe Race.  I was getting ready to start a marathon training plan for this season and decided I needed a new pair of shoes.  I bought these based on all the other reviews stating how wide the toe box is and the fact they are zero drop!  First pair i bought was a size 10 as that is what I wore in the Nike Free and Zoot Kiawe Race.  The Altras were a little too small, returned for a 10.5.  PERFECT FIT!  I have done multiple long runs in these shoes including speed and tempo work.  Average weekly miles in these shoes is about 30 miles.  They have been great so far!  I will definitely buy another pair of Altras when these give out.\n",
    "they didn't fit well. Love the shoes.\n",
    "These are thin and comfortable in my dress shoes! Helping with my plantar fasciitis.\n",
    "These shoes were larger than I expected and I should have listened to other buyers.  I reordered a smaller size and they now fit pretty good and look great.  Overall i'm pleased with the comfort and looks.\n",
    "comfortable\n",
    "Nice sneakers, my son loves them!\n",
    "These shoes feel great on my flat feet.  I have a wide forefoot and narrow heel and this shoe works for that too.  I have had sciatic problems and an injured left knee, and I can wear this shoe all day long with comfort.  I spent 3 days walking for hours at a golf tournament and felt I could not have done it without these shoes.  It is the most expensive shoe I have ever bought and it was worth every penny to me.\n",
    "These are some of the best shoes I have ever purchased. My close friends all said I was crazy when I told them how much I spent on my new, New Balance shoes, but I am confident with my purchase.<br /><br />I work as a photographer, taking photos all day long for hours on end. Even after spending one of my longest working days (13 hours) on my feet, they did not hurt. I was not in any discomfort whatsoever, and am sure that it was because of how great these shoes are.<br /><br />They may be a bit pricey, considering New Balance doesn't sell anything more expensive, but they are so worth it. If you are looking for a pair of well-made, high-quality shoes, then these are for you.\n",
    "Nice looking shoes! Chosen for a trip.\n",
    "i sent them back. they were too small for my kid, and though the quality is decent there is no excuse for charging $60 for these silly things. they are flimsy slippers.\n",
    "Probably should have gotten a half size smaller, but still a good shoe.\n",
    "I wanted a slipper for around the house that wasn't a thong, didn't cover my whole foot, and wasn't fluffy, and these fit the bill. I love these slippers. They're the same kind my grandma used to wear around the house all day. The mesh is great because it lets your feet breathe, which is awesome for those hot summer days. It's lightweight, and the sole is a very dense foam, so it provides some cushion while not feeling flimsy. They also stay on your feet surprisingly well for a slip-on.\n",
    "Love, loVE, LOVE them! Perfect with tights, skinny jeans, dresses... You name it, they go with it!\n",
    "So much comfort!  I have a wide foot and have been searching for cute wedges for an upcoming vacation.  This is my first pair of UGG's, but they are as comfortable as I would have expected from the brand.\n",
    "hiked 20 miles aound Mount Rainer on first wear.. no problems\n",
    "Fast Delivery of the shoes.  I love the Saucony brand the comfort and fit of the shoe are get whether you are<br />wearing them for daily wear or for running or jogging.\n",
    "Can be dressey or casual\n",
    "I have had so many compliments on these sandals! I love them! No, they don't provide much arch support, but I typically do not expect that from a flat sandal. They are quite comfy to wear all day. I am a teacher and have worn them to work, I must say I am impressed!\n",
    "These Crocs might be fine but they said child/toddler even on the tag, and they are almost big enough to fit my wife.  Probably not a huge deal to return them in the US, but we are overseas so it is a pretty big pain.\n",
    "Love the shoes!\n",
    "I love this purse! It is well made and sturdy. It has a lot of space and pockets. The only thing I would change is to have the handles just an inch longer so it can go on your shoulder better or have the extra strap shorter.\n",
    "They fit perfectly (size 1)\n",
    "Not for wide feet\n",
    "The leather is very nice and the interior is as well.  The main zipper looked to be messed up but once I unzipped and rezipped it seems fine; I'm hoping it holds up as the purse is used.  However, the shoulder strap was a big disappointment.  The wrist strap is beautiful like the clutch itself, but the shoulder strap is a tiny strip of that leather on a stiff, bulky black canvas or something, totally too casual a look for dressier look.  (I definitely don't plan to use the shoulder strap and it was the one I really wanted for that.)  If you're looking for a nice clutch or wrist bag, this is very pretty.\n",
    "excellent shoe\n",
    "My husband loves his new boots!\n",
    "Love these heel boots they are so sexy on and easy to put on<br />they are true to size<br />great for thick legs\n",
    "Not good qvolity\n",
    "The shoe fits really good it my first time ever buying a pair of Nike flyknit\n",
    "The on;y problem...they make my feet sweat.\n",
    "Great for shoes, leather, saddles,\n",
    "This clutch is elegant and look way better than the picture shows. The only complain is that some of the stones are coming out. Would be nice to include some extra stones for replacement.\n",
    "Returned too small\n",
    "fit small and they look very small\n",
    "Good looking shoe and extra padding/foam bottom for a heavy runner.\n",
    "Super cute shoes, but they were too small.  The next size up wasn't available but I kept checking back.  When they were avail, the price increase made me mad. So I didn't end up getting them. :-(\n",
    "These boots are beautiful and fit perfectly. I bought the size I normally wear in a boot and they are just right. The laces do actually adjust and there is a leather tongue behind them so you can open the front up if you need more room for your calf and there isn't a bunch of skin or stocking showing.\n",
    "I now have these in both black and silver and they're just fab!  Great looking and comfortable enough to wear all day long!\n",
    "These are really pretty shoes, I ordered them in white and they look really nice, but the toe box was a little too pointy and made my size 11 foot look even longer:(. I still highly recommend them because the are attractive pumps!\n",
    "You can't beat these shoes for the price!\n",
    "Nice!\n",
    "By far best running shoe for those on the husky side. It's has amazing arch support and does not wear down as fast as other shoes. I run about 15 miles a week. Amazing shoes!\n",
    "I have owned a pair before and really enjoy them over other flip flops!\n",
    "Absolutely adorable with lots of cool blinking lights!  Unfortunately  these run smaller than other Geox shoes of the same size.  Hopefully I can exchange for a larger pair.  They arrived on time and well packaged for shipping.\n",
    "Absolutely beautiful, very well made. Like art for my feet. I love them.\n",
    "These shoes are stylish and comfortable.\n",
    "nice boots little narrow for wide\n",
    "Very nice boots it fits on me :-D...\n",
    "Third pair for me, just love,love,love them.\n",
    "Ive hax great experiences with this boot.  I wear them as a combination of daily shoe,  work boot,  and motorcycle boot.  They are comfortable like sneakers and offer the protection i was looking for as a summer/short ride motorcycle boot.  They have lasted for a little over 2 years where i used to go through otger boots in 1 year.  At the end of their life the leather,  stitching, and tread all wore out at the same time.  Maybe a downside for some but i dont care is the black color fades to green as they age (see pic of 2.5 ywar old boot) I went through 2 pair of laces.  I wish this boot was one of their made in the USA boots.  I would be willing to pay more if it was.\n",
    "I have had issues with my feet for years. I've spent thousands of dollars on shoes the past 5 years. I was worried about buying shoes at all online, but the price was great and they looked exactly like what I was looking for. I was familiar with the brand and their quality, so that eased my mind a bit. I've tried Clark's and they had no cushion or support. Same with all the other brands, high end or not. These boots are great! They are very comfortable and cushioned. They look really nice. I've gotten a bunch of compliments every time I wear them.\n",
    "I've been getting this shoes since iteration 13. They have always been great, and this iteration are a lot lighter than 16 that I had before.\n",
    "Nice polarized, lightweight, good quality sunglasses!  Can't beat that for $13!\n",
    "Great shoes but felt narrow!\n",
    "I normally wear a size 9.5 so I ordered a 10. It is really tight and I can't wear it comfortably at all.\n",
    "The quality meets my expectations for the price. Love the one for one philosophy of Toms, it's made me a lifetime customer!\n",
    "Love them! Just what I was looking for...thanks\n",
    "I LOVE the hoka One Women's Cliftons.  I tried on the Clifton 2s and there is no comparison in width and comfort.  I will have to buy another pair on line before they disappear since Hoka is not replicating this great shoe!!!\n",
    "I love it!  Amazing! I want all the colors.\n",
    "Very pleased!\n",
    "A bit on the short side for an 8.5 but since only for a costume they'll do. I would order at least a half size up though.\n",
    "Order them a size larger than you think you should so they fit.\n",
    "The bend lines cut into my foot, so I can't give it a 5 star.\n",
    "I bought a size 7 because I heard these run large.  ( I am a 7 1/2). The 7 was still big.  But it did allow me to put in arch supports so now it is very comfy\n",
    "Stylish and functional!\n",
    "It is so hard for me to find boots because of my calfs. These boots are amazing, comfy, and most importantly fit my big calfs!! I highly recommend them, especially if you have the same problem as I do!\n",
    "Love these... Ton of compliments! Comfortable!\n",
    "Beautiful shoe. Fits very well. The unique clasp took me a second to figure it out. And the silver material of the actual shoe was slightly peeling in one small spot. But I'm not fussing. It's an all around beautiful, comfortable shoe that I can't wait to wear.\n",
    "I own several pairs of Skechers sandals and I am giving three stars for two reasons:<br />1. they run a bit large and loose;<br />2. The straps are hard and not that comfortable as those made from fabric martials.<br /><br />I got them at a good price and I am keeping them. I wish they make more of those with fabric material on the straps which stretch and offer more comfort and flexibility.\n",
    "They fit let kid sunglasses. The lens where not very clear and scratched easy. Not very comfortable to me at all. I have long eye lashes and they rubbed.\n",
    "Nice and comfort\n",
    "I have had the classic Blundstones for 15 years and this year I decided to get fancy. I'm really glad I read the other reviews in advance about the sizing: these boots really do have LONG toes because of the shape. Every review recommended that I order a size down.  I did and they fit PERFECTLY.  (My other blunnies are a size 8 US Women's, and I ordered a size 7 USW for this style.)<br /><br />Also, they are wonderful boots but do take time to break in.  For example, if you were to use these for horseback riding and you decide to wear them for the very first time cow sorting for 2 hours you will be sorry.  Start slow.\n",
    "Greatfit\n",
    "First pair of two ATTCL glasses I bought (second pair was their wayfarer).<br /><br />Same love for both, same criticism for both.<br /><br />Awesome high quality glasses but the nose stands are too small for the weight, not a big issue unless you wear them for hours straight.<br /><br />Got lots of compliments on both pairs.\n",
    "I love the look of the snearkers, but they are not very comfortable.  I wore them for spin class, and my feet hurt.  However, they are comfy for walking.  Saucony is an excellent brand of running shoes.  I swear by them; however, this model is not made for exercising.\n",
    "Very beautiful.\n",
    "Great for the price. Exactly what I expected. Nicely packaged.\n",
    "need to re-order\n",
    "These are bright shoes, and definitely true to the picture! They are comfortable, but definitely make sure that you size up at least a half size. They are extremely well made and cute shoes. These will be a fun addition to my summer outfits.\n",
    "Great Buy!\n",
    "I should have listened to the other reviews.  I could not get my foot into the boot.  Shame...because these are well made, lovely boots!\n",
    "I really liked these shoes alas, so did my dogs. Goodnight Sweet hush puppies. You will be missed.\n",
    "Great fit very comfortable\n",
    "These are so cute! They fit snuggly, so if you have to wear socks - wear thin ones or stockings. Also it wouldn't hurt to scotch guard them, as the material can easily get dirty from everyday wear. Overall I love them.\n",
    "I don't feel that I'm wearing a shoes , light and comfortable.\n",
    "Nice looking shoe that fits well. Extremely comfortable.\n",
    "Pretty much liked the shoes, but they hurt across the base of my big toe. For this reason, I returned them. They also had a weird tongue set up if you laced the last hole- didn't come up to the top of the laces. My first pair of fitness shoes...maybe they're all like that. They are not made for cushion and support, IMHO.\n",
    "the boots were way to tight.  I ordered the size I would wear in Red-Wings or Carolina's and these seemed to be extremely narrow boots.\n",
    "Loved it as soon as I saw it and immediately got disappointed when I tried it on )-: like someone else posted, bout a half size too small. so bummed, wish they had it in half sizes or a 12. considered returning and ordering a 9 in men's, but its just not the same since this is a wedge and the men's is just a regular straight flipflop.\n",
    "My dog ate my first pair of wedges, they were my favorite pair as well. I could not find them at other shoes stores, checked here and I found them. I wear these wedges to everything, work, church, parties, and everything in between. They are comfortable and easy for me to walk in. Thank you amazon for having them.\n",
    "It's too narrow for my girl\n",
    "These are really good for the price. They are comfortable and warm. I have bigger calves and these fit me good. I liked them enough to go back and buy them in black!\n",
    "I have very narrow feet so these were just fine for me. The heel is perfect for walking long hours\n",
    "Great fit and great shoe!\n",
    "Somewhat tight in the heel, but otherwise very comfortable.\n",
    "I like these boots, didn't fit too big like many other people said.. I'm usually a 7 1/2 and that's what I ordered, and they fit with socks which is what I like.  I think the heel might be a little cheap, but for the price, not bad.\n",
    "So many lints!! But my son love them\n",
    "I was running out of silver sandals so I decided to go for this beauty. As I know from previous purchases, Walking Cradles makes decent, stylish and comfortable sandals. I was not let down, the sandal fits perfect, looks really pretty, has rich leathery feeling, no straps cutting my toes is an intelligently designed slingback, so you can put them on in seconds and wear them for days on end. Combines well with all my summer dresses, skirts and shorts. May summer never pass :)\n",
    "excelente\n",
    "Comfortable fit, perfect fit, I love this shoe.\n",
    "Love this purse, soft & perfect for every day\n",
    "Love these glasses.  So cute and they fit great.\n",
    "I have severe plantar fasciitis and require prescriptions meds.  I have not been able to walk normally for 6 months and these shoes plus another Sofft shoe have literally been a god send.  In fact I just bought two more pair and I have 3 other pair of Sofft is another style.  These re fantastic!!!!! I feel as though I can run a marathon. The are almost like birkenstocks but without the severe arch support.  These are a lighter arch support but great.  Buy them - you will not regret it.  Also - you can wear this particular pair with skirts.  LOVE THEM.\n",
    "I like it. so comfortable, highly recommend!\n",
    "Love it. Big and roomy. It's  fun and I look forward to using it\n",
    "Perfect size purse..I absolutely love it!!!\n",
    "I tried these on as soon as they arrived. I love them! They fit perfectly and look so cute 😍\n",
    "These are really good shoes. They are nice, soft leather with good, grippy, flexible soles. Momo tends to run a little big for my child's feet, so I ordered the 5.5 instead of the 6 and they fit perfectly.\n",
    "I have always wanted a pair of yeezy's. I've been homeless for quite sometime now and these were definitely a life changer. The price was a little expensive, and being a homeless man, these were not even an option. I was doing some research at my loval burger king and found out that my dog that meant everything to me,  a Duck Tolling Retriever, went for 3000$. So the next day  I took my dog max to the local breeding parture and they offered a solid 3700$ and I took the deal right away. The next day I bought myself a pair of yeezy's and boy although that dog meant a lot to me, i will never regret this decision. Slipping my foot into the each soul made me feel rich. These shoes helped me lose my virginity and get me an office job at a glass company. These shoes have def. changed my life. Love you Max.\n",
    "Great shoe but slightly over-sized and will likely stretch further\n",
    "Great quality!!  Extremely light!!!!\n",
    "Much comfort  fits great.\n",
    "Returned for a larger size\n",
    "Great fit! Love these sandals!\n",
    "Cool runnings man\n",
    "I got these for hiking but I've been wearing them everywhere! So many compliments on them.\n",
    "I love these shoes!  They are so comfortable and are my new favorite sandals to wear.  I've gotten so many compliments on them too!\n",
    "Runs very small\n",
    "10 points. everything was as expected\n",
    "Arch support is ok, but the sole does not have much support. Feels like you are walking barefoot.\n",
    "Adorable boots, good for the money...got them as a gift and my sis couldn't be happier!\n",
    "It's light and comfortable, and I like it!\n",
    "I thought this pair of shoes is so nice....... Love it\n",
    "It is larger than expected (or rather longer than expected). It is hard to get into the shoe but once my feet are inside, there are too much space inside it. The top part is flatter than usual, so putting insoles will not work for this. However, i like the style -  it looks unique - rugged and yet with feminine touch. The grey looks darker than expected. My friend saw my shoes and like it so much that she ask me to order one for her too! :)\n",
    "I cardiovascular heavy and after 6 workouts these shoes are my favorite....\n",
    "happy with my new work boots hopefully in about  a year or so we can purchase a new pair threw amazon\n",
    "These shoes are stylish and on trend.  The heel is just right, as I don't feel comfortable in really high heels.\n",
    "Good product but the shoe size is rather smaller than the regular size 40\n",
    "It arrived in time. Fits great!\n",
    "Not the quality I was expecting, but I guess you can't expect much at this very reasonable price. Still, It's lovely, and big enough to hold the contents of my purse. I likely wouldn't buy it again, because of the lower quality, but I like it enough to be happy with my current purchase.\n",
    "Great quality just a little snug and feel they will stretch some.\n",
    "Great Shoes for walking and running, but I ordered a size up as stated by the company and they were to long.\n",
    "Freaking Fantastic!\n",
    "After a few bumps in the road, everything worked out and I couldnt be happier. Kudos to Supplier My Shoes for following up with the<br />USPS and rectifying the problem.<br />The shoes are as advertised and I would buy again.\n",
    "liked my reeboks and they wear well\n",
    "Fast delivery and perfect fit.\n",
    "I bought these a little over a year ago primarily for running, but also as a general use pair for driving, fishing, and other outdoor activity.  Look, they're $30, and I'm not buying them for fashion--I'm buying them for utility.  And to be honest, they did exactly what I expected.  They weren't too tight, but the rubber nose and temples kept them snug on my head so that they didn't shake or slip when running (I don't have a wide head).  And the vision was solid.<br /><br />A month or so ago, I was bummed when the right lens cracked a bit while in my carry-on luggage.  Last week, I noticed that JiMarti offered a warranty on breakage, so I sent an email to the company on their website with a screenshot of my Amazon order.  Today, a replacement pair showed up in the mail.  Thank you, JiMarti!  I'm looking forward to many more months of active use.  They were worth every penny I spent on them.\n",

    "Most comfortable golf shoe I have ever had.\n",
    "The most comfortable shoes I've ever bought\n",
    "Loved the shoes- very comfortable. The reason I am leaving one star is because after wearing the shoes 4-5 times the strap broke as I was walking. I live in New York, and thankfully I was on my way home, but still had to walk to the train, get on the train and walk home. I hope a fill refund from bass or Amazon.\n",
    "Love!\n",
    "The box came smushed\n",
    "I love these. I love that they are only suede on the sides so I don't have to be quite so conscious of how I step. They are comfortable and because they are nude can be worn with pretty much anything. They are a bit more of a pinky nude, if you have darker skin at all they might not be the true nude shoe you might be looking for. I really love it though because I am super pale and most nudes look like more of a tan on me. ..\n",
    "Bien\n",
    "Nice shoes the only problem is the size, these shoes are small so I have to return the item and ask to change from 10 1/2 to 11 1/2 and now they fit ok\n",

    "You can't go wrong with Stride Rite.  I bought this brand for my kids when they were little and now I buy them for my grand kids.  Always great for toddlers with wide feet.  If buying through Amazon, please know the prices vary among vendors AND prices will vary among the sizes within the same vendor as well.  For instance, occasionally I find that a shoe will be one price for a particular size, but then when I go up a half size, it will be cheaper.  If you love Stride Rite like I do, and you buy them through Amazon, I recommend you shop and compare thoroughly.  My daughter-in-law bought a pair through Amazon Prime and then I found the exact same shoe and size on Amazon Prime, but different vendor, for $11 cheaper.  Luckily the more expensive shoes were easily returnable through Amazon, but it just demonstrates you really need to shop thoroughly.\n",
    "Fast service, true to size, and comfortable. The only thing I'm disappointed about is the wear on the front shoe looks nothing like the picture. It looks like someone just speared a strait line of a lighter color.\n",
    "Beautiful case and great decor! However, my case has a  slight defect so that I cannot close it properly; when this case is closed there is a shift between two parts.\n",
    "Great price, quick shipping, great quality.\n",
    "Great shoes and a great price👍👍👍\n",
    "I love the 1100 series volleyball shoes made by ASICS. I use them for clay court tennis because they fit my foot better than tennis shoes.<br />the toe box it a bit bigger in volleyball shoes....the bottom of the shoe is the same as asics clay court tennis shoes so they do not damage the court surface.<br />Also, I find the price is usually better.\n",
    "Good fit. Very light.\n",
    "The stitching came loose on the front of the boot midway through the first day of wear. They are attractive looking boots, but the craftsmanship is extremely poor. Couldn't believe boots at this price point held up for less than a day.\n",
    "I am usually not a flip flop person but I thought I would give these a try just to wonder around the house and yard in. I actually really like these and am happy I made the purchase. These are more comfortable than many other flip flops I have tried to wear. Would recommend!\n",
    "Looks and feels great. Goes well with my suit.\n",
    "Quite comfortable although the straps are large even with the buckles.  Luckily they aren't necessary to have tight to wear these sandals.  I wore them for 3 or 4 hours and totally forgot I was wearing new sandals/shoes until my mom asked if they were new.  I showed them off proudly even though my mom's eyes were a bit large even as she said how nice they looked.  LOL  Lots of strappy-ness.  Comfortable even on my 63 year old feet.  Its nice they are flat, no wobbling as you walk.\n",
    "The White Cream is perfect for leather shoes!  It goes on easy with a small rag.  It keeps it shine and never looks streaky.  I have<br />used it for years!  It seems to protect my shoes,with other polishes my shoes always cracked after a year.  I give it five stars!\n",
    "Really nice flat boot.  Looks good and feels good too.\n",
    "very nice booths\n",
    "Can't wait to wear these with my distressed jeans!!! :-)\n",
    "These help keep my feet protected when I'm working with my horses.  They also go on my foot well considering I have a high instep.\n",
    "My wife loves it. WIll order in the future.\n",
    "For the right pronation these would be perfect but not good for me. Had to return\n",
    "The colors and style of this bag in the photo and description are very true to it in person. It's very bright and bold, I love it!\n",
    "Glad I purchased them the most comfortable clogs ever I wear them all day going up and down stairs and my legs and feet fel great.\n",
    "Very neat product! It arrived much sooner than expected and was a nice surprise. You get what you pay for.\n",
    "Very good as usual\n",
    "thank you\n",
    "Size runs small\n",
    "Beautiful clutch purse.love the size and quality too.\n",
    "Soft and comfortable, but my feet often hurt the next day.\n",
    "Love it. It's everything it looks like in the picture and more. Has three pockets inside, the largest one has a zipper so you don't lose your change all over. Better quality than I had expected for the price. this is a medium sized purse. I can fit all my good stuff inside without it being too clunky like a tote. Would definitely recommend.\n",
    "good item\n",
    "Strap shorter than expected\n",
    "Been wearing the shoes for a week. They feel great and seem very durable.\n",
    "Great court shoe & competitive price!  Leave it to Amazon...\n",
    "Despite reviews suggesting that these ran small, I ordered them in a 9, because there were no 9.5s, and I assumed the 10s would be too big. WRONG. My toes hung over the ends of the 9s, they were so small! I returned them and ordered the 10s, which fit perfectly, length wise. I do find that they're a bit loose across the toes, though. Beyond that, these are super comfy and pretty cute, especially for the price.\n",
    "Fits great. Been wearing for about 3 months coaching twice a week. Two complaints.  One, laces are crazy long, had to replace with old laces. Two, upper is very plastic, hard to get good feel of ball.  But hey,  they were only $20.\n",
    "These are well made and stand up to outdoor use. Comfy in the house as well. The slippers are true to size and are a great deal.\n",
    "Awesome fit.\n",
    "I love the style, especially since I've been looking for one with a toe loop for a long time. At first the left shoe was a little more snug than the right  (for whatever reason)  but after wearing them twice, they were broken in and perfect. The brown is quite dark just in case that is not what you're looking for, and the buckles work just fine. I got a size 6 and they fit like a glove.\n",
    "the only thing wrong with these shoes is they squeek when you walk in them. maybe it is the leather, but they do make a noise. other than that i have gotten many remarks about how others like my shoes and ask me if they are comfortable. yes they are comfortable and sturdy with great arch supports for those of us who are on our feets for long hours.\n",
    "Amazing product\n",
    "Good fit, comfortable, and looks great with jeans.\n",
    "Beautiful but little too small\n",
    "great boot! nappa leather needs very little break in… pretty much comfort out of the box\n",
    "Simply :-(\n",
    "Fits\n",
    "Thank you Amazon I love it.\n",
    "good shoe\n",
    "Great\n",
    "Awesome fit. Very fast shipping. Will buy another pair soon. Great price too!\n",
    "I've ordered these shoes before, but had lost them. I LOVE these shoes. Worth every penny. They are true to size!! So comfortable and cute. Love them.\n",
    "It is just as pictured and perfect clutch. It has two chain straps to pick from and is very pretty!\n",
    "Shoes are too big overall.\n",
    "These run very small.  My son could not even get his foot in.  I held them up to his other new shoes and there was over an inch difference.  These come from China and do not have free returns, so I will donate them.  I'm only giving them 2 stars because they are good looking shoes.\n",
    "I wear 11.5 wide in dress shoes, running shoes, cross training shoes, casual shoes and boots.  These were way too narrow and short in 11.5 wide. I'm hesitant to try another size since they were so far off I couldn't even put them on.\n",
    "I was really looking for something bigger.  But that is my fault I should have looked at the measurements.  Picture of girl with bag is deceiving\n",
    "Bought these for a trip to Costa Rica.  We planned on some excursions like river tubing and hiking.  I was able to wear these from one activity to the next.  They dry quickly, I would say a few hours in the sun or overnight in shady conditions.  My only gripe with them was sand, when sand gets in them its difficult to get it out.  Wearing them in the ocean caused them to fill with sand.  You had to remove the shoes and rinse it really well.  I would not suggest them as beach shoes.  I really like that they don't look like typical water shoes.  I have no issue wearing them with or without socks and they are comfortable all day.  I have wider feet and they fit well.\n",
    "Love\n",
    "Said to order 1/2 side and they were right.  Fits perfectly.\n",
    "great little rainboots - great price\n",
    "awesome product at an awesome price!\n",
    "I love these shoes, very comfortable.\n",
    "This was my second amazon sneaker purchase. Came with original box, new and as described. Checked out the sneakers and it doesn't look or feel fake to me. That would be a hell of a good job if they were fake. Runs true to size. Some people may feel a little rubbing on the pinky toe. A lot of Jordan's come like that. There made to break in over a long period of walking or fit like dress shoes. However, if that bothers you, I would half size up.  Glad to see Amazon have retro Jordan's! The price is a little higher than released. Not to drastic. This is what you pay when you miss the release dates or if its exclusive for a limited time. I still cant believe people paid thousands of dollars for patent leathers back in the days. The cheapest price was like $2,500 for used ones to like $8,000 for new ones.\n",
    "The boots were nice, but I returned them due to small fit.\n",
    "Well over all it turned out okay, but I wasn't pleased with promptness or the lack of communication. Therefore the 3\n",
    "I needed a western boot for a country-western theme party and I was looking for a great price, DONE! The fit was exactly as described in the ad, and this boot looks as pictured. Yes, it is long and pointy in the toe, the expected look of a dress-boot. Because it was such a low price, I half-expected trouble with the fit and with the quality, but both were top-notch. I am pleased with this purchase.\n",
    "I loved this shoes and I hope purchase but the shipping it's very expensive, I would like to  make the purchase free . I  will be grateful to you 😚\n",
    "Perfect for Golf beginner.\n",
    "These are the 6th or 7th Asic Gels I've owned....if you have a wide foot make sure to get the wide.  Otherwise these are great all around shoes.\n",
    "One of the best shoes I have ever worn.  I do wish they had just a little thicker  insole but that is probably just me. &#34;This is how I felt when I bout this shoe to the point I bought another pair. These fabric shoes is week and in one month they developed a hole in them so know my other pair may have to be house shoes. I really had high hopes for this model.\n",
    "Shoes ran very small....should order a full size or size and a half larger\n",
    "Perfect fit great very comfortable and shipped quickly very happy\n",
    "I love it. That's all that I can say.<br />But unfortunately, I had no notification from amazon\n",
    "Fit too big\n",
    "I am constantly getting compliments on these boots. They are true American classics.  Quality does seem higher than the normal/work Red Wing boots.\n",
    "I love these sandals! They are very comfortable.\n",
    "I've undergone Plantar Faciial release surgery on both feet, the Vionics shoes I've recently purchased are working great. Comfortable,\n",
    "I can run in these if I wanted to,and keep my feet warm during winter.\n",
    "Great sneakers, super comfy!\n",
    "I have 3 pairs, and my feet love them!\n",
    "Love the bottle opener!\n",
    "Really cute little purse, looks just like the image in person. There is something about it that makes it look just a little bit lunch-boxy (although it's too narrow to be used for that really), but it's really super cute for anyone of any age I think.\n",
    "I cannot possibly be the only one who's getting tired of the &#34;hand stitched&#34; advertisement that comes with Born shoes. I own 12 pairs of Born sandals and every one of them after about 3 months has the same problem - the bottom sole separates from the insole. Yes they both have stitching but are not stitched together but glued. If they were not so comfortable I would have given up a long time ago; but due to foot problems Born shoes are the only ones I can wear. Please Born.....at least use a glue that lasts!!!\n",
    "The silver detail on the heel is cool but unfortunately that's all that I can say that is positive. The shoes are extremely tight and I can't wear them. The material of the shoe is sort of quilted and it doesn't have a nice finish. I would NOT recommend these shoes to anyone.\n",
    "I bought an evening back that had a long gold shoulder strap, not, fan of all chain straps and found this one that works perfect.  It sits at the perfect length under my arm...\n",
    "Firmer than expected.\n",
    "I needed a 20 slot wallet I am pleased to find one at this price. That being said, I would have gladly paid more for one of better quality overall.\n",
    "These are perfect! Very groovy!\n",
    "These shoes are perfect! So perfect I'm buying another pair today. I'm a size 7. It fits like a glove. It runs a bit small but I'm sure after a few wears it will fit as it should. Very happy!\n",
    "These I bought for my daughter. She Has told me that they are the nicest sunglasses she has had. States the make things outside on bright days much clearer and has no eye strain. VERY HAPPY\n",
    "It is ok!\n",
    "These are my favorite boots!\n",
    "Only reason for giving less than 5 stars is that they need to Hi-Light that these son glasses have a very large bridge and will not fit most people.  Black fly's are an excellent manufacturer of shades though.\n",
    "These run very small \u001a\n",
    "I haven't worn these boots yet, but tried them on and they fit; I know nine west shoes/boots run a little small so I ordered a 9.5 instead of my normal size 9. They are slippery so I  added  the anti-slip pads on the bottom of them.\n",
    "Good boots not non slip through. For the price they are surprisingly comfortable\n",
    "They feel like you're walking on pillows. They are a bit warm to wear in this heat wave but all speakers are. Looking forward to wearing on my daily mile when it cools down.\n",
    "Cheaply made\n",
    "Good fitted shoe. Wears well.\n",
    "Perfect fit, very comfortable, great price. No complains here.\n",
    "The shoe was too small, returned and havent replaced it with a larger size. Cant say much about the shoe since she didnt didnt fit in it, but she seemed to really like the style and it was very light weight.\n",
    "I have several pairs of Climacool running shoes so I had to try their golf shoes. They are light and breathable. I like them!\n",
    "My daughter really liked the shoes and she wears them all day, every day!\n",
    "Ever since I broke my foot 3 yeas ago I have needed supports in my shoes to be able to walk and stand comfortably. I started buying Crocs to use for around the house and to run errands. They were ideal for me right from the start. They provide perfect support for both my now healed foot and my other foot.  I also wanted some Crocs that didn't look like the famous original Crocs.  This design is ideal for me. It looks like a regular canvas shoe but with the famous support and feel of original crocs.\n",
    "This is my second pair of these shoes.  On e of the most comfortable and longest wearing shoes I have owned. The new pair feels slightly larger than my original pair, but still are satisfactory.\n",
    "When I first tried them on, they felt like I might get a blister from rubbing in certain areas.. however no blister ever formed and they basically molded to my feet. I have flat feet and they are great.\n",
    "Loved it when I first got it. Has lots of room and is super cute but the stitching came apart and I  couldn't use it after like a month.\n",
    "I have a number of pairs of reef sandals.  The strap on these is not as soft as some of the other models.\n",
    "I absolutely love these shoes! I wore them standing/walking 16-hours a day and they are truly comfortable. I only gave the product a three star rating because after 6-9 months of wearing them the insoles began to slip up towards the heel making them uncomfortable/unwearable. I may have wore them down quickly and wished they lasted longer.\n",
    "To tight, sent them back\n",
    "This is my second time buying these shoes. Very comfortable and goes with just about anything. They can be casual or dressy.\n",
    "They are great! Fits as expected and look brand new:)\n",
    "great shoes, very happy with them!\n",
    "cute shoe but too narrow for my sons feet.  If your child has chubby or wide feet, good luck getting them to fit.  I even bought a half size bigger so he would have some room to grow into them.\n",
    "These boots are amazing! They're perfect for the fall season!\n",
    "Comfortable and true to size.\n",
    "bastante bueno.\n",
    "Very comfortable love this shoes\n",
    "Love it\n",
    "I would give them 5 stars but they are just too narrow and they don't make cycling shoes wide.  I bought them a little big and they  feel great.\n",
    "Fits extremely well, has a very comfortable feel. I turned around and bought a backup. The manufacture always change style.\n",
    "Have not worn the boots yet.  But did try on to see if they fit with thick socks, as they did.  I ordered a size-up so I could wear the boots with socks.<br />I was surprised the boots were matt leather since I was expecting shiny leather, however I am sure after a few polishings they will look more weathered.  I have high arches and bunions so find boots/shoes hard to fit me.  However, these boots seem really comfortable.  I will wear them in the fall when the weather gets cooler.\n",
    "I love my boot\n",
    "Not as shinny as the picture and a little snug, but not a bad value at the price\n",
    "Great product!  Arrived on time\n",
    "They were cheap, but made poorly. They rub my feet at the seams,  and the vinyl has a rubbery feel.\n",
    "I bought this to replace my failing Croakies ARC wire cord and it works much better. The ball at the end of the strap allows this to adjust the length of the strap as well as act as a weight for the strap to rest against the back of my neck. Note that these will only work with small and thin frames.\n",
    "Fantastic pair of shoes! Will wear them at least a year if not more!\n",
    "They aren't sneakers but these balls help the ones you own smell good. I also use them in my boat shoes.\n",
    "I love these flips.  I only buy this brand.  They do fall apart after some use (maybe 6 months) but I wear everyday. So I buy more.  Cute design and very comfortable.\n",
    "Smelt sooo weird\n",
    "Great shoe I love them there suede really nice and they came 3 days early thanks amazon\n",
    "The shoe is long and narrow, so it was not a good fit. It seems well built, but I retuned it because it was just not comfortable.\n",
    "I receive compliments of these when worn, but find I don't reach for them very often, because they are quite wide. I have always worn an average width. They aren't unwearable, but if you don't like a wider shoe, skip these.\n",
    "My husband loves theses slip on shoes!  Very comfortable Crocs.\n",
    "3 stars as of now.  There a little tight. Also the color is wrong. Or I might have ordered the wrong ones.  But I can't give a full review.  Until I wear them\n",
    "Vertico sandals are very comfortable to wear. I hope to use these for many years!\n",
    "These slippers hurt my feet so bad but I have plantar facitis in both feet lord my  arches feel like knives are stabbing me when I put them on pain and more pain. I got these shoes cause I have flat feet .they are hard as h--.run don't buy these shoes\n",
    "Niece loved\n",
    "The shoe just did not look good on my feet. Looked very flat on the instep. However, overall it's a really cute shoe, the fit was good, possibly a bit wide for my slighlty narrow foot. I am a 10-10.5, often need an 11 in closed toe, and the 11 was correct for me. I think it would look cuter on a wider shorter foot. Seemed to have good support and cushioning.\n",
    "The look of the shoe is a solid, clean look.  I like that a lot.  They are comfy, cushy, and light just like the old Free Run 2's.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for the same arch support you got in the original 2.0's, don't buy these shoes.  I have been on a mission to find a pair like the original Free Run 2's because my old ones are super worn out and the new 5.0's have horrible arch support.  I thought and hoped I'd found the right shoes here, but I didn't.<br /><br />If you don't have high arches these might be great shoes for you because the support in these 2's is still better than the 5.0's.  However, if you ARE like me and you have high arches, I don't recommend these shoes.  The support is insufficient and you will probably hurt your shins or your feet (depending on how you step).\n",
    "OHHH my new favorite flip flop ever!! Just ripped open my package and put on my new flip flops and don't want to take them off! They are literally the most comfortable flip flops I have ever had, more comfortable than reefs and fit flops.  They are cushy, and soft and don't rub anywhere like others do.  Size fits perfectly.  I love the logo detailing on the inside of the straps too.   Can't wait to get another pair.\n",
    "Very, very, pleased with this footware, received many compliments\n",
    "I'm on my feet at work up to 11 hours a day. Before I got these shoes my feet ant legs and back were killing me at the end of the day.  Now at the end of the day I'm feeling good and not having any pain. Thank you Nunn Bush!\n",
    "We are asolo die hards!last pair lasted 9 years, we hike at least once a month if not 4 times, averaging 10-40 miles a month! But like all shoes, your foot will know if the size and make and shape is meant for you. Happy trails!\n",
    "Works great to keep the bright headlights muted.\n",
    "Such a classy looking shoe I love them.  Wore them to my daughters wedding, couldn't believe I actually had them on for six hours and feet felt great.\n",
    "I love Reef flip flops and these are the most comfortable I've had from them yet.\n",
    "Nice boots. Different from what i`m used to, but liking them a lot. would probably buy another pair in the future.\n",
    "Love the shoes!  Have had them for 2 winters now and they are still in great shape.\n",
    "I know this are supposed to be dance shoes but I used them to throw on my track and field team. I throw shot-put and discus. it supported my foot perfectly with throughout all of my different throws. if you're a thrower and don't want to pay for super expensive shoes these are great especially if you use a south African throw for discus. if you looking for a dance shoe I would also recommend these as I do actually use the for my dance class at the gym. the only problem is that they are a little too big and you don't have much time to exchange them. my where delivered a few days late so i was unable to exchange them for the right size so if you are going to buy these buy half a size smaller. I wear am 8 but I should have bought a 7.5.\n",
    "Very Happy with the new Gel-Kayano 22's.  Like the 21's, these are very comfortably cushioned at the heel and fore foot.  The toe-box is snug and the heel counter provides great support.  I am a mid-foot runner and these allow and guide you to stay in line and I don't notice the high 12 mm toe drop, it actually feels lower that that, which is a good thing for me.  At 10.9 ounces the shoe feels light and great for my tempo runs.  I'm training for a marathon in November '15 and I'm happy these came out for me to train in and use for the race.  I've already logged 100+ miles on these Kayano 22's and so far it's been very durable.  I've also ran in the rain in them and they have pretty good traction.  I'm definitely going to buy 2 or more pairs as I love these shoes!  Everything I expected in the shoes from Asics!\n",
    "Although they are very stiff at first (to be expected with a wooden sole) these are the only shoes that I can wear standing for about 5 hours without my feet hurting.\n",
    "Fits well, no toe crack peepage which I hate! No tread though, can be slippery on certain floors\n",
    "I was so nervous to order shoes from amazon but i wasnt disappointed at all. I wear NB all the time especially for work. I especially love the 515 style for yhe comfort and style. I absolutely LOVE these shoes snd the color! NOTE: The blue is actually brighter than pictured but that's even better. Overall im pleased with the comfort style and shipping speed and will order again soon.\n",
    "Pretty cute for relatively cheap shoes. A little taller than expected, but I'm 4'10&#34; so it's tough for little girls.\n",
    "Love them!!!!!! I absolutely love them, really cute and comfortable.\n",
    "excellent\n",
    "Perfect fit, size, color, clarity, weight, hold, etc.  Want 10 more pair.  Absolutely love these!!!  I have a medium size head, 6'3, 190, thin/athletic build.  Baseball cap size 7 1/4 I think....\n",
    "Excellent product. I love it. Recommended.\n",
    "Great out if the box. Perfect fit, very comfortable, good traction. I live  Colorado and I love these!\n",
    "As for comfort these shoes are fantastic. However I question how long they'll last since after wearing them for just one day then left shoe started coming apart where there outsole is attached to the toe. I would be way more bothered had I paid full price but since this item was discounted and I'm pretty sure no longer in production, I guess I can only complain a little. Very comfortable and I'll buy new balance again, just not the minimus.\n",
    "Really nice shoes, lightweight and they fit my son great.  No complaints and he seems to like them a lot.\n",
    "Love Clark's shoes.\n",
    "This product was purchased to use in gym showers and it is comfortable for that purpose.  Personally needing much more support for long term comfort, my go to slipper is Fit Flops, also available on amazon.  For the general public I think the support would be good.  Having tried on Croc slippers in the stores, I note they vary greatly in the height of the arch, the height of the heel and overall comfort.\n",
    "got these for my boyfriend who does construction and he said they are very comfy.\n",
    "These were an adorable shoe; however, they run quite small. I typically wear a 7, but I opted to order a 7.5 as I own another pair of Me Too shoes in that size. The 7.5 was far too small in the toe. I'm not sure an 8.0 would have been large enough. Too bad! Very cute. Size up!\n",
    "Super comfortable.  Have ran 4.5 miles yesterday and felt great.  Wanted the wide toe box and mesh sides due to bunions. :(<br />These are going to work perfectly.\n",
    "Love these shoes.  They look great, feel great and fit just as expected!\n",
    "These were for my granddaughter and she's the one that loves and wears them a lot.\n",
    "Very comfortable shoes! Only wish I could get them in the nude color!!\n",
    "Really nice sandal! I might be happier if the sole were a bit more cushioned, but I'm not going to quibble. It is cushioned, and well supported, and very comfortable, and what I was looking for.<br />Be aware: Although it does have three adjustable velcro-closure straps, two of the straps are redundant for non-adjustable straps in the same places (the heel strap and the toe strap). Usually I stay away from sandals with non-adjustable straps, because of the width of my feet, but these straps give very ample room in the 3E size -- the ankle strap bit more so than the toe strap..[[ASIN:B00ED7JX1S Propet Men's Anderson Sandal,Black/Grey,13 3E US]]\n",
    "Small\n",
    "Exactly what I was looking for - right size and full zipper on top to close.  Needed something to carry my extra change of clothes etc for flight and wanted something that would stuff under the seat but not let everything fall out.\n",
    "My twin toddlers have feet that are more narrow than most, so it's usually a struggle to find shoes that aren't too wide. These fit the width of their feet perfectly and are lightweight. These are also very cute shoes and nicely priced!! Very happy with this purchase.\n",
    "i like it! it is my size, it is comfortable for me, and it is look very good! I am satisfied with my order!\n",
    "Good insoles with lots of arch support.  Normally I don't wear shoes for a long period of time as I am retired so I can't say how comfortable they would be if worn all day.  From my experience I would say that they would be better than no arch support.\n",
    "Best shoes ever\n",
    "nice\n",
    "Puma is my favourite brand and these sneakers from Puma is no exception.....just loving it\n",
    "These were a gift for my mom and she loved them. Very comfortable she said.\n",

    "They fit perfect. and look amazing. Haven't gone dancing yet with them, but I can't wait.\n",
    "Love Carlos!\n",
    "These run small order a size up\n",
    "I have always loved these shoes. No one in their right mind would SUE because they didn't lose weight wearing them. They help my calves tremendously. I am hard on shoes & these will last me to the end of May. I am a Custodian & I will always buy Skechers as long as they are available & I can afford them! Thank you so much for having them ready & &#34;waiting&#34; for me!!! Love you Amazon!  Barb Z.\n",
    "I have purchased this sandal b4.  Excellent support and comfort.  Great arch support.\n",
    "Thank you. Fun shoe\n",
    "If you have foot problems these are the best flip flops out there.  And the shoes by this company are great too!<br />I've had my fit flops since July and just three days ago they broke, the strap between the toes.  I just call The Gear Coop and left them a message.  I ask for a replacement pair since I've only had them less than 5 months.  I wear them everyday because they are the most comfortable shoes I own!\n",
    "Wonderful quality.  I purchased 2 of these elastic straps to add additional elastic to my daughter's pointe shoes for ballet.  They provided the needed support.  They weren't exactly the same color as the elastic on the Bloch pointe shoes that we purchased, but they were very close.  They were shipped the same day and arrived very quickly.\n",
    "Too small.  About 1/2 size. No support. Daughter liked.\n",
    "I love this purse. It looks smaller in the pictures.. it pretty big, overall great purchase and great price.\n",
    "these nb shoes are incredibly comfortable and well sized. i worked on my feet all day indoors on cement today and my feet felt great, never got that soreness in my lower legs/knees or tightness in quads like i do when on my feet for 6 to 8 hours.<br />the memory top insert is the first thing you feel when slipping these on. it feels like youre sliding your feet into a glove.<br />wow, and for the $ these were the best shoe pickup ive ever had. (i ordered a 10 and fit perfect.)<br /><br />i recommend these to a anyone doing a variety of activities throughout a day.<br />so comfortable\n",
    "Ordered in narrow and fit perfectly.  grasshoppers have been around for a long time and I can always depend on them fitting great and being comfortable from the first time I wear them.  It is difficult to find arrow shoes now days, but you can always find narrow Grasshoppers.  Thank goodness.  great everyday, comfortable shoe!\n",
    "Changed colors and shoes no longer match.  Look at the photos.  One is grey while one is brown-ish... I've hand washed them and it hasn't helped.  Looks like they used a different material on the front.  Fits great.\n",
    "good purchase for a great price!!!\n",
    "Glad to find these shoestrings.  A bit expensive, but shipping and handling do that, I guess.\n",
    "Tight around the toes but loose at heel. Not very comfortable.\n",
    "Bought these shoes to wear with my Dickens character outfit as they are as close to the time period shoes I could find I really wasnt expecting them to be so comfortable\n",
    "My daughter loves them.\n",
    "Love them\n",
    "I wish Nike hadn't discontinued this model, very comfortable\n",
    "Size is not accurate.\n",
    "Great fit, great price, great shoe!\n",
    "Super cute on my daughter! She loves them!\n",
    "I love the Original SWAT Metro boots, they are hands down the most comfortable boots on the market right out of the box. I bought two pairs to rotate every other day so that they don't wear as quickly. I've used boots from 5.11, Magnum, Bates, Thorogood, Danner, Converse, Oakley and Under Armour but for comfort Original SWAT is the winner. Even though they are comfortable after one year of daily use (with rotation) the sole is starting to separate from the boot at the heel on both pairs. I suppose that 6 months is about the average lifespan of most boots where the sole is glued to the boot but I did expect that they would last longer because I rotated both pairs every other day. I had a similar problem with the Original Swat Chase boots after about the same amount of time. I tried the Winx2 boots but they were uncomfortable and not even close to the metro comfort wise. If you are ok with replacing your boots every 6 months then these are great, if not I'd go with a boot that can be re-soled.<br /><br />*** Update 11/26/15 ***<br />Recently the side zipper broke on one of my pairs during my shift rendering the boot useless. The other pair is still functional but one boot has developed a squeak even when walking on non-smooth surfaces. Though I love the comfort of these boots, I won't be purchasing side zip boots anymore and may consider a different brand as replacing boots every 6 months gets old, and expensive.\n",
    "Great, comfortable shoe!\n",
    "I recomend all Birkenstock shoes.\n",
    "Wrong color so I returned it\n",
    "Very nicely made and pretty comfortable to wear too. Will buy again soon!\n",
    "Nice product.  Sizes run on the small side. I normally wear a US size 11 and I had to exchange for a size 12.\n",
    "I am sending this bag back. It is much smaller than described on the site. I can fit a 70 sheet notebook in here, and that's it. It is definitely not functional for work unless all you need to carry around is a notebook and a pen.\n",
    "Shipping was fast... runs big my baby is 6 months with big feet her feet is 4.5' so I ordered 0-6 months and fits perfect with a lil room to grow... I ordered in beige they look so cute on my baby\n",
    "My second pair and I will definitely be buying a 3rd! Excellent shoe, washable, and comfortable. My first pair has lasted one year so far and still going strong.\n",
    "I just got my boots so haven't tried them out in winter weather yet.  I have very wide feet and was also concerned about the fit around the leg/calf.  I usually wear 7-1/2 to 8, so to accommodate a heavy sock, I ordered 8.5 WW.  The fit is fine, in the leg and foot length,  but beware, as mentioned in another review, the toe area tends to be a bit narrow, even with a WW boot size.  I'm sure they'll be fine if I wear a thinner sock as they are a very well insulated boot so warmth should not be an issue.\n",
    "Love it very nice came early\n",
    "Comfy shoe used for walking several miles per day for exercise.  Love the gel in the ball of the foot and the rear--not many shoes have gel in the front.  Replaced the GT-2000 with these to try and so far am happy with them.  Had to bump up 1/2 a size from the GT-2000, so they feel slightly large, but not uncomfortable.\n",
    "He liked the shoes but he said they were too tight at the toes. I am going to order a size bigger.\n",
    "Great Style.\n",
    "They arrived fast & were beautiful!  I bought them as a gift and she loved them. Now I want a pair for me! :-)\n",
    "These shoes are legit they look nice and will fit well with any pair of shoes you have. Get them before they sell out!\n",
    "My second pair of Meleen Crocs...so comfortable...love them!\n",
    "The shoes are comfortable.\n",
    "Bought a half size bigger since they run small and they fit great. Good price for Junior volleyball shoes which are so hard to find. Very satisfied.\n",
    "I've purchased at least 3 pairs of Pedipeds per year for the last 7 years. My daughter loves the fit and the quality has been outstanding until now. She wore the Bailey model last year, but this year I purchased the Anna model for her school uniform shoe. After 1 week ( 5 wears), my 2nd grader's shoes were peeled badly. She did not touch them or peel them; she didn't even notice until I showed her. But the material is peeled all the way off the first third of the show and the shoe looks ratty. Extremely disappointing.\n",
    "This was my first RYKA. Purchased one more last week. And contemplating another! They fit me better than the lavishly priced Nike/Pumas..\n",
    "nice shoes\n",
    "Arrived as expected\n",
    "I have wide feet and I'm also 5ft 10&quot; so finding shoes that fit are always a challenge. Nine West is one of the few good brands that carries a 10.5 which is my actual size. Most brands go from 10 to 11 - size 11 isn't a perfect fit for me (only works if the brand runs small). I love these shoes! Wore them for a 10hr day and got so many compliments and they were so comfortable. Definitely a great buy!\n",
    "I'm very satisfied with my new shoes. However, I am more impressed on how easy the return process was. I really like the fact that I received my new shoes without having to wait until you received my previous ones.\n",
    "Very narrow sandals even though i order bigger size than the size chart advice me . The sandals straps are hard , there are not flexible with your feet motion or movement . The front is really narrow and it an give pain in the sides bones of your feet . I don not recommend this sandals for wide feet people . I test them in wet floor and they are really slippery you could fall .   If any one knows a sandals brand that have wide size please let me know thank you\n",
    "Can't wear with pants tucked in because I have a wide calf but other than that they are great boots. Wore them today to work and it made tromping through the rain pleasurable.\n",
    "These sandals felt good right away. The strap over my toes started to annoy my<br />foot a bit after wearing them 4-5 hours. I like them a lot though.\n",
    "Very nice bag. Better tgan i expected.\n",
    "I had to return the original pair as too small but I ordered half size bigger\n",
    "Finally, I am able to walk with less foot pain.\n",
    "excellent product\n",
    "Fantastic\n",
    "shoes are very comfortable. I am completely satisfied.\n",
    "Good\n",
    "my boy loves them!\n",
    "I'm used to wearing very minimal Merrell barefoot shoes, so I was surprised by how large these Sketchers make my feet look!  The flexible sole is what sold me on them, over other nursing shoes, such as clog styles.  The flexible sole is comfortable; the memory foam insoles are very comfortable and are removable.  The non-fabric upper is appropriate for the medical field.  Overall these shoes work great.  I have high arches and plan to add an arch cookie for when I have to spend many hours on my feet.  My only complaint is that the material listing is misleading: it should not mention the word &#34;leather&#34;, as there is no leather - &#34;man-made&#34; or &#34;synthetic&#34; is all they should specify!  I thought they meant the upper had both synthetic and leather pieces.  I would definitely recommend these to people who need white non-fabric work shoes.\n",
    "I work on concrete surfaces from 8 - 10 hours every day. These shoes are extremely comfortable and fit well.\n",
    "Excellent!\n",
    "Chose these shoes based on the similarity of a pair that I already owned and loved.  True to size and style, these are perfect for me with good arch support for my daily treadmill workout.\n",
    "I spite of the fact that the package was well protected, there was a hairline scratch, which I debated whether or not to exchange or return.  A little disappointed that it was also smaller than displayed.\n",
    "I like the shoes a lot, very comfortable - that said, TAKE THE ADVICE OF THE OTHER POSTERS!  I wear a 9.5 in Foot Joy shoes...thankfully I went to 10.5 in these at the advice of others, and they fit great.  MAYBE I could have gotten 10s, but 9.5 would have been way small.  So, I don't know if it's Foot Joy or Puma with the error, but use this as your guide if you're coming from FJs.  These shoes are very comfortable for sure!\n",
    "Ive done my research and these boots are hard core great. If I could only find them in women friendly sizes? I cant find them in Womens, (HELCOR) so im trying to match my size up with mens sizing. Im a solid 8in wmns, and Tims run big so unfortunately im returning these. Boo. I really hope these find a home since they are great for snow, mud/water, scuff and rough workwear, and stylish! The HELCOR material these Timberlands are made of are seriously unbreakable. So you don't even have to baby your boots and worry about getting them messed up. They can take care of themselves, and they will take good care of your feet!\n",
    "Exelent boots\n",
    "MATERIAL COMING OFF HEEL AND A BAD CHEMICAL SMELL AND VERY NARROW\n",
    "They are nice sandals with a cute design. I have another pair of the Sanuk basic black yoga mat flip flops, and the sizing is a little different. These ones run a little bit smaller, but look a little more\n",
    "Not much support...hurt my feet even with my insoles in them....spring step shoes way more comfortable...I've had 4 foot surgeries for plantar fasciitis. ...These made my feet hurt worse. Buy KURU Carreras. ...no heel pain at all.\n",
    "Could not be happier with these shoes! Comfortable and good for walks, trails, standing and regular walk-around wear.\n",
    "Very comfortable\n",
    ":)\n",
    "Finally a sandal that you can get wet that doesn't look too bulky!\n",
    "Did not give my feet any support\n",
    "Excellent\n",
    "Keep my plantar fasciitis at bay.  I have these in all my shoes.\n",
    "I have been wearing this exact same brand and size for years. My other pair was looking pretty shoddy so I ordered another pair. This pair runs small and is very uncomfortable, I have tried &#34;breaking them in&#34;, but sadly, they are simply too small. Again, I have an identical pair that fits perfectly, so not sure what has happened...regardless, I now have a pair of $59 shoes that I cannot wear :(\n",
    "Cute shoes! Fit nicely for a petite 9 year old girl.\n",
    "They look great.  No binding around the ankles.  Very comfortable.  Would've been nice to have some arch support with the platform because the shoes do not bend as you walk, the soles don't flex, however the footbed is very soft.  As I write this I'm a bit indecisive about keeping them for the no-flexibility reason...but the shoes look so-oooo good and the camel color is awesome!  I am so torn...\n",
    "The inside liner keeps coming loose s d bunched up under the foot.\n",
    "Love these Zumba shoes! Can move around without pain in my feet. Not recommended for walking.\n",
    "Very comfortable shoe, I can wear it all day at work. The shoe is soft, and it does not stretch out throughout the day.\n",
    "Love them! True to size. Arrived quicker than expected.\n",
    "I've been waiting to buy these boots for weeks, and it stinks that they were way too small. I even went up a half size, but color and style are pictured well.\n",
    "Super cute but very narrow!\n",
    "Love this! I have wide flat feet and bunions, even though I typicall wear 7 1/2 I ordered a size 7 because Vionic reduces over-probation, and naturally realigns your feet over wear. It fits perfectly, and since I love the other pairs so much, I've order a few other vionic slippers, wedges, and sandals.\n",
    "Nice\n",
    "Love this shoe. And the seller was great.\n",
    "My feet are currently enjoying these shoes, every day for a week now. These are my everyday, in and out shoes for puttering, playing with the dog, etc.  I ordered two sizes, the usual half size up based on feedback in reviews, and my regular size. I have to return the regular size, too short. The fleece lining is thick, certainly takes up room, but after a week I can say the half size up is perfect. Suede stretches, the fleece compacts, so far so good.  Arch support is decent, weight is good, soles very nice. I am pleased with these. They are cute, too.\n",
    "I have always been happy with this shoe. They last forever. Also very comfortable .\n",
    "Gorgeous! Heel is not too high. Quite comfy (but different from regular shoes)\n",
    "Great value.\n",
    "do not it as well as other skecher scandal that I purchased.\n",
    "Love, love, love it!  The leather is super soft.  2 main compartments really help me to organize all the junk I carry around with me.  So glad I bought this.  Would buy a second in a heartbeat!\n",
    "I've been looking for comfortable shoes for some time. The term &#34;relaxed fit&#34; for these shoes is very appropriate. They aren't loose and fit very comfortably; regular width shoes can often be uncomfortable for people with arthritis. They are light, and handle hot temperatures well (I live where summer temps are often above 100 F). I recommend these highly if you have had difficulty with the usual regular width shoes.\n",
    "beautifull color, i really fall in love, but it is too small, i really dessappoint\n",
    "These are as close to going bare foot as you can get and still be allowed into public places; and I can walk all day in them without any foot pain at all.\n",
    "My daughter normally wears AFO's and is unable to stand or walk without them. I was looking for something for her to wear around the house, for short distances, without needing to wear all the AFO gear. Unfortunately for her, the memo sandals still didn't give her little ankle the support she needs to feel comfortable walking. They are so so cute. High quality shoes. I'm sad they didn't work for us\n",
    "It is for a cosplay of mine and it is exactly what I was looking for, Thank you.\n",
    "These were very chic as expected. Love them!\n",
    "It is ok. Not the best quality. The pros are that it is light and comfortable but don't expect to walk in it for hours.\n",
    "i like them.\n",
    "I love these shoes and I own three pairs.  HOWEVER, two out of three pairs in less than one season have started to fall apart.  It's almost like they went short on the amount that was tucked under and sewed in as the cloth on the footbed starts to pull away become untucked.  You also definitely do not want to come in contact with any water, as the falling apart process will accelerate.\n",
    "Love them!\n",
    "Just right for a travel bag.\n",
    "It looked ok, but the zipper always got stuck and the lining behind the card slots came out. Waste of money.\n",
    "I´m very dissatisfy with this shoes, it´s running TOO NARROW on fingers, I´m been buying cole haan for the 19th last years, and this is the first pair with this problem for me, it´s impossible to use.\n",
    "They are cute.  I gave them to my daughter because they are too small.  They are wide as well.  My daughter and I have narrow feet.  They are comfortable.  For somebody with a wide foot, I would say order a size up and you could walk around Disneyland all day.\n",
    "I love this bag although mine differs from the current image!<br />Amazing quality in every way!\n",
    "My daughter loved these!\n",
    "The shoes look great but they have a very strong smell of rubber/faux leather. People could smell it from a distance. It smells &#34;cheap&#34; :-(\n",
    "Too big for my face...\n",
    "PRO: These shoes are super cute. They look great, and seem to match with everything. As with most Tom's shoes they are generally very comfortable.<br /><br />CON: The picture of these were green. They're not. They are beige. I looked it up and since no green version of this shoe exists, I kept it. However hopefully others realize when they are buying not to trust the picture.<br /><br />CON: I have semi-wide feet and they are a bit tight on the sides and pinch a little. If you have slender feet, they would probably be the most comfortable shoes ever, however if you have slightly wider feet, just be prepared they will pinch. If you have wide feet? I wouldn't consider these shoes at all, otherwise you would have very angry feet after wearing them.\n",
    "Very comfy!! Great shoe! I can wear these all day with no pain!\n",
    "I would buy again\n",
    "Love at first sight!!! I'm a Gucci girl and these are perfect. My sister and I rock them!!\n",
    "The only downside to these super cute shoes is wearing them in wet weather. The sole of the shoe becomes very slick and your foot will slide out so I don't recommend wearing them in the rain or if you know it will be raining. Otherwise, I love them and get a lot of compliments.\n",
    "Works great for a floor installer who rips apart the toes on all work shoes until these\n",
    "Very comfortable shoe. My only problem is I really need a larger toe box due to the orthotic I need to wear but the shoe itself is great !  It's supportive and very light weight.\n",
    "Their great\n",
    "I order size 6, but they run too large. Its the worse purchase i ever done in my history.\n",
    "I have had another pair of Merrell converible sandals for years and loved them but they are clunky looking.  These have the same comfort but are far more attractive.\n",
    "These boots are comfy and cool , love the material, super soft.\n",
    "first day it is broken. I do not like it\n",
    "Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned!!\n",
    "Quality is very low, I just took one look and they were back in the box being shipped back. Sorry but cheap material on my feet is not something I can handle.\n",
    "laces dig into the top of my foot, I am adding a piece of leather to the underside or replacing the laces with soft ones. I think i can dance in them.\n",
    "loved them and have actually worn them out and need to try to find another pair.\n",
    "I bought these slippers in a size Medium from another retailer and they were a bit shorter in the toe than I expected.  I normally wear an 8 to 8.5 shoe.  That said, they're made very well - durable leather suede with thick wool shearing throughout the inside (very soft - not itchy at all).  I gave the Medium's to my daughter who pretty much claimed them when I discovered they were too short in the toes for my feet, and she rarely wants to have them off of her feet when home.  The same daughter rarely ever wanted to wear slippers that she had in the past - she loves these that much (which makes me happy as the floor of our basement duplex apartment can get very chilly in winter). I have since purchased a size Large of these slippers from Amazon so I can have my own pair.  I love them and totally recommend them.  Note - although they are not constructed with a 'non-slip' style bottom (the bottoms are made of the same leather suede that the rest of the outer walls are made with), they (so far) have not been slippery at all, even on the smooth kitchen floor.\n",
    "Love these sandals. They are so comfy!! And, is wide enough for my wide feet.\n",
    "Too wide and too big\n",
    "I love them! They fit great and they arrived weeks before I was expecting them! I am very pleased with my purchase and with shipment!\n",
    "These are great! Really comfortable, was a good price and great to walk in all day.\n",
    "i'm a J Renee wearer 99% of my dress shoes are J Renee . I was shocked this shoe ran small.\n",
    "Comfy but not true to size.\n",
    "Very good\n",
    "My son loves these. He wears them all the time.\n",
    "Works just right for me at work cute colors.\n",
    "The sides and bottom is a bit thinner than I am used too. I got complements.\n",
    "I bought these shoes in black last year and really liked them.  I needed a pair of these same shoes in red this year, but everyone was out of this color.  Then, I thought of Amazon and they had my size in red.  These sandal can be worn for casual or dressy.  I also like the fact that they have velcro adjustable straps.\n",
    "I love these sneakers.  I need them in different colors.\n",
    "Great shoe.  Perfect fit.  Can not go wrong with this product.  I would buy it again.\n",
    "I love these shoes but they are too tight across my instep. I have to return them.\n",
    "Does not fit as well as the older H701334 Caribbean Coral Thong it replaced. This shoe has a raised heel pad, the older shoe  had a cupped hell support that prevented side to side slip when walking.\n",
    "Nice looking and more importantly, look like the picture.\n",
    "I bought these for stepping in and out of my tent, walking to the restroom while keeping tootsies warm and clean! They were prefect! It says men but i bought the women's sizing. I plan to use them as my new slippers for winter!\n",
    "Such a Beautiful Shoe!!! Bought for my son's wedding. Not sure if I will be able to last the whole night in them. But, gorgeous!  They have a really nice subtle sparkle to them as well. True to size. Although, I will say seem a bit wide. Going to try the ball foot pads and see if it helps with this and adds comfort.\n",
    "Great fit.this is my second pair and have had no problems\n",
    "These puppies are so comfortable I put them on as soon as I get home from work. Will order the next pair two sizes longer. Things are a little snug right now but the slipper soon molds to your foot.  4.5 stars!\n",
    "These are great shoes as expected from Clarks.\n",
    "Very happy with my purchase. Promt delivery. My son loves them and has worn them to school everyday since we received them.\n",
    "She loves them, comfortable and as cute as the picture\n",
    "This is the perfect shoe, for me, for table tennis!\n",
    "the most durable pair of slippers for men in the market. Rainbow Sandals keeps making it happen.\n",
    "love chacos and always wear them BUT... this brand was the first one that actually broke down on me.  the side straps DO NOT go all the way through, like they do on the unaweep models.  if the strap is not connected, it WILL pull out at some point.  this did.<br /><br />  we shoved the strap back in where it pulled out using a butter knife and then shot in some gorilla glue (only thing available).  it worked temporarily and had to be done again.  the last time, the gorilla glue expanded to form a lump.  we crushed it down, so now, they seem to be holding.  still, its just a matter of time.<br /><br />  chacos are a great brand, but stick with the z1 or the z2 if you *really* use them.\n",
    "Good product ...<br />Price are bit expensive\n",
    "These are gorgeous shoes! I ultimately returned because I found another pair I fell in love with, but the choice was not easy! Would have loved to have more occasions to wear such a lovely shoe because I would have kept if I thought I could get reasonable use out of them. Fits true to size.\n",
    "Best buy ever!!\n",
    "Wayfarer style.  They look great. Lenses are a little cheap (plastic) but for the price they are perfectly appropriate, especially since they are polarized.  Great for driving or by the pool.  Kept one pair, gave one to my wife.  Would definitely buy again!  Please note these are MATTE finish.  Turns out I like that better than glossy but was surprised when first opening.\n",
    "I just love this shoes!\n",
    "Love this shoe, have worn it most of summer, great with dress jeans, will buy this brand next year.\n",
    "I expected more arch support for the price.\n",
    "Good quality, comfortable for all day use.  Unfortunately they don't make it anymore.\n",
    "Perfect for those with a wide foot. Very comfortable. I walk a lot for work and these have never given me any discomfort. Highly recommend.\n",
    "very comfortable and light.  appropriate for soft feet that want to run everywhere.\n",
    "Cute but way too big.\n",
    "I love them I've been looking everywhere for them.\n",
    "Although I put it as Fit as expected, This is because it is as what a size 5 while i am more of a 4.5M. So it is slightly loose for me. I wish they make smaller size shoes though.<br />Overall, it has a nice professional look, and is comfortable. The quality looks good.<br />The white is white so that is one key reason why i like it.\n",
    "First time buyer of walking shoes by Skecher...Great shoe!!\n",
    "These are a little flimsy and the &#34;leather&#34; was pretty smashed up and wrinkled.  They work for a little girl in dance who doesn't need something fancy, though.\n",
    "They do not have a removable insole, only problem.\n",
    "I was only disappointed in the color.  I was looking for burgundy, when it came. it's much lighter than the picture.\n",
    "It's a great shoe. They look exactly like the picture shows. I have no complaints. I would recommend taking into consideration the fact that you won't be wearing socks when selecting the correct size. The sizes run the same as all other Adidas shoes. I wear an 11.5 in Adidas and I bought an 11.5 not really thinking about the fact that I wouldn't be wearing socks. It's slightly loose, but still okay to me. I might get a 1/2 size smaller next time.\n",
    "These are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I am actually wearing them now!!!! I LOVE the heal!! And they're pretty. I have 2 pair.\n",
    "I purchased these locally for a lot more money. Lynco makes a fine product.\n",

    "Cute, but not really comfortable. They are tight across my arch and by end of the day...ouch. If I could do it all over again I would order them in wide. I was in a bind and needed to wear them otherwise would have returned them for another size.\n",
    "blingy sparkly shoes downside is the beads fall off with extensive wear returned the first pair because it was missing stones not a good shoe for everyday wear do to cheap stone attachments! ! Bummed a bit but cute on, fits great!!\n",

    "Great sandal!!!\n",
    "After reading a few reviews, I decided to get these a half size larger and they fit well with some room to grow. Of course you can use the little tie in the front to tighten the shoe around the foot. So with this, they work well! And they came in the cutest box. Now her feet won't get dirty in our mommy and me class :) (she's only 2.5yrs)\n",
    "Excellent Thank You\n",
    "Shoes required a break in period.  They were cheap and I intended to wear them to work.\n",
    "Well constructed, very sturdy.  Would purchase again.\n",
    "Gave it as a gift and loved it so much, got one for myself.  Roomy, and well crafted.  We really love this!\n",
    "These slippers were given as a gift and my dad absolutely loves them.<br /><br />As is characteristic with these types of slippers, the rawhide &#34;shoe laces&#34; on the front don't always want to stay tied when you cross your feet while laying in the recliner.  My suggestion to my dad was apply a small dab of wood glue or Gorilla glue to the knot and snug the knot up tight - that should hold it in place.  I've done that before on similar styles of slippers and it's worked fine.  This minor issue is not a problem with this specific L.B. Evans slipper, but rather this style of shoe/slipper so no deduction of stars here.<br /><br />While my dad has only been wearing them for a few days now, he says that they appear to be very well constructed and are very comfortable.  He doesn't wear socks with his house slippers so these fit very well in his normal shoe size and he loves the fleece lining.  All in all, in his estimation, they are outstanding slippers and, in my opinion, they were priced right!\n",
    "Sturdy and pretty. Large main compartment for the student who needs to carry the backpack around with her all day at school.\n",
    "Nice pair of shoes\n",
    "Just like I expected from Jenna Kator. I have another purse from her that I really like and was hoping this one reached my expectations and it does.<br />The layout of the bag makes it very user friendly.\n",
    "great product , totally recommended\n",
    "Shoes tear after 4 months, Bought them twice and had same experience .<br />Would not get close to Skechers FlipFlops again.!\n",
    "Although I returned it was great quality and exactly what I wanted. I failed to read the size and I wanted larger.\n",
    "There great shoes but they get hot and it starts to where the leather off and fades color . But for just playing there great ! Great touch great shot and pass and it comfortable !\n",
    "Joya shoes are the best shoes on the Planet. I have flat feet and would need to wear inserts in any other shoe, but I can be on my feet all day without inserts with Joya Shoes. I own 5 pairs, including hiking boots and they are all amazing. They have my highest recommendation.\n",
    "Strange, but I purchased size 8 and there were small for me and 8,5too large, Usually I have no problem with shoes but here I need to find something else\n",
    "Good product, good price , good service\n",
    "Great shoes for use on a treadmill workout.\n",
    "Fabulous.  LOVE platform, peep toe, slingbacks, and these are so comfortable!\n",
    "purchased for granddaughter with a wide foot. she loves them.\n",
    "Very cute boots.  Listened to what reviewers said and I ordered a 6 1/2 instead of my usual 7.  Fit is nice. Leather is a bit cheap looking but the style of the boot is very cute and unusual.  I will keep them. Price was great.\n",
    "Just tested these out this weekend hiking and they are so comfortable. I'm a size 10 but ordered a 10.5 as I was recently on a long hike with size 10 sneakers and towards the end the downhill was killing my toes. Just enough extra room. Buy these!\n",
    "They looked too manly, especially with the seam down the middle.  Couldn't feel good about these no matter how badly I wanted to.\n",
    "Great for wide flat feet\n",
    "like the look\n",
    "Love the shoes! Fit perfect! Look great!\n",
    "I was sent a pair with elastic straps. I do not like the look or feel of them, and they make putting on the shoe annoying . I ordered a size up and they are extremely snug. I would have worked on stretching them out, but I chose this style specifically because I wanted a pair without straps. So...fail.\n",
    "I've purchased many pairs of Fit Flops.  I love them!\n",
    "The shoe would have been very comfortable, it was soft, the footbed lining was very cushioned, I liked the heel height and the non skid sole, but I'm in-between a size 5 (too small) and the 5.5 slipped on my heel.\n",
    "I wanted these to work, but the front toe strap was much too narrow.  I have a foot that is on the wide side and I couldn't even get my toes to the front of the shoe because the leather strap is so narrow.  The leather is very stiff and not pliable so I am not sure if they would have stretched out.\n",
    "Excellent shoes\n",
    "I love Clarks.  I have wide feet, plantar fasciitis, and lots of other feet issues.  I can wear Clarks for long periods of time without pain.  The sandals allow me to wear sandals comfortably.  Love them.  Have five pairs of these sandals in different colors\n",
    "They were exactly what I wanted and they fit perfectly! Great product!\n",
    "Onex is the only brand sandal that I wear.  They are very comfortable, wear right out of the box, and can wear all day. I have then in many many colors.\n",
    "I love that they are wedges and my people loved them to\n",
    "it is pretty good if you run\n",
    "Thanks\n",
    "Cute boots!\n",
    "Love them!\n",
    "Perfect  size\n",
    "Perfect could ask for more and came heeps early\n",
    "These were a VERY cheap copy of the real Pulltaps.  I am VERY dissappointed.  It couold not be returned.\n",
    "Great pair of Shades.  Reasonably priced!\n",
    "Very comfortable sandal.  I was able to wear it all day while walking in NYC & Philadelphia.  Only problem is the black dye rubbed off on my feet & made them look dirty!!\n",
    "Sharp looking shoe that can work with a suit or jeans.  It's slightly narrower than expected, but one you break' em in, it's fine.<br />That narrowness cost it one star.\n",
    "Great fit & very comfortable\n",
    "I wear a 9.5 in most closed toe shoes. These fit ok in a 9.5 but with a reg sock my big toe was hitting the end when I walked. I returned the 9.5 and got the 10 and it is a much better fit with a hiking sock. The thin insoles were easily removed and I replaced them with an OTC orthotic sport type insole and this is perfection. I can't wait to get out and hike in them this fall. Great purchase! If you like a little more toe room or like to wear a thicker hiking sock go up 1/2 size. I don't think you would be sorry, and at this price?! Wowzaa!\n",
    "Nice and comfort\n",
    "I like the purse part... but the concealed carry part is way to small for my standard 9mm\n",
    "The sunglasses are more the size for  a child to wear them not a adult very disappointed\n",
    "Love, love, love these sandals!  So cute and very comfy. The navy blue is clearly blue, not black or denim blue!\n",
    "Great shoes, great service\n",
    "I returned them.\n",
    "the shoe runs small.  Ordered my usual size 9 and was too small the 91/2 fit but still heel is not fully on bottom could use 10 but I kept the 91/2.  I have other Cobb Hill shoes not open toed and the 9 fit perfectly.\n",
    "Excellent this is my second pair. I got a wide this time so I can wear bigger socks. With the laces it works perfectly. Great pewter color . it's a favorite\n",
    "The best shoe ever\n",
    "Flexible but run small.\n",
    "Love Melissa shoes.  Have many.\n",
    "greta shoe. will buy again\n",
    "I love these for work but they were some what large so I had to return and order a size dow.\n",
    "Love the look, but the fit is a bit weird. Started with an 8 (my normal size) and they looked way too bug, but the bottom straps were tight. Sized down to a 7.5, and had the same problem. These are just very long and skinny shoes - beautiful, but an odd fit...\n",
    "Nice looking.  Like the organizer.  Great value.\n",
    "Looks exactly like the photo. BUT! The color was a little off.<br />I got the rose red and it came to be more of a dark fusha color. Still cute though. Shoes feels light and it's very comfortable. Also, shoes was perfect fitting. I wear a size 9 so I got a size 9. PERFECT!  Definitely a keeper.\n",
    "Very comforable for all day use.<br /><br />I wear a 10.5 in most brands but based on reciews I ordered a 10 and it fits perfect.\n",
    "squeeks when walking only down fall\n",
    "This is a wonderful shoe.  Fits well (I have very narrow feet), super comfortable and light.  I'm happy to pay the extra for a product that is made in the USA.  So why 2 stars?<br /><br />I have worn this model for several years.  The first ones started to smell like cat urine (the outside of the soles near the heel) after a few months wear.  New Balance replaced the first pair TWICE at no charge, saying a problem with some adhesive caused the shoes to develop an odor similar to cat urine.  This year, they decided they would not replace them since they were way outside warranty.  That is perfectly understandable.  So I bought a new pair in January, 2015.  Seven months later, one shoe started to have that cat urine-like smell again.  It was only on the outside.  So I contacted New Balance again.  Here is their response:<br /><br />&#34;I am sorry you are experiencing an odor issue with your 990 shoes. I understand in the past we mentioned the odor issue is caused by an adhesive in the shoes. I would like to correct what we have told you in the past. After research and testing we have found the adhesive was not the issue in the odor issue. What we have found the odor is from moisture getting trapped in the shoe and the shoe not being able to completely dry out. The odor does take time to develop within the shoe if not completely dried out before the next wearing.<br /><br />The 990 shoe does have a less breathable upper which makes it harder for the shoe to completely dry out before the next wearing vs. shoes that have a mesh upper are able to dry out at a faster rate than the 990 shoes. We have also found the best way to dry out the shoes is to remove the insoles, loosen the laces, and pull the tongue forward. This is the best way to dry out the shoes to help prevent the odor issue.&#34;<br /><br />Thanks, New Balance, for the explanation.  But please ponder this.  One shoe of my current pair (7 months old) has that odd smell on the OUTSIDE of the sole, not the inside.  If it is a moisture issue, why doesn't the inside smell like the outside?  So far that question has not been explained to me by New Balance. And I don't believe I have exceptionally sweaty feet.  Plus, this has not been an issue in any other shoe I own.<br /><br />Again, these shoes are not cheap.  And I will gladly pay for US-made shoes.  And the fit and comfort are exceptional.  But please consider the odor issue when purchasing.\n",
    "Amazing classic shoe that makes me feel like a white person from the northeast!\n",
    "Great Shoes for cheer\n",
    "Just recieved these and was kinda nervous ordering online before trying them on first, but I absolutely love them!!! Color of these are awesome and they fit perfectly. Nice case that comes with them also definitely a thumbs up!\n",
    "My child loves them!!!!\n",
    "The Skechers were recommended by my physician to help heal my plantar fasciitis.  The first pair I bought several years ago had the sole separate and fall apart. I decided to try again. The pair I bought a month ago are falling apart on the inside. The liner is tearing and shredding. I hope they will last another month since they cost over $100.\n",
    "Sent them back, to tight\n",
    "3 stars at best, took these on a few light duty trails and they were fine, not as much cushioning as my aging feet like but they were decent. Brought them on a fairly serious hike on Glen Boulder Trail -&#62; Mt. Isolation up in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, ran most of the way, I'm an aggressive descender and weigh in about 190#'s. Several of the lugs ripped off and they look like shoes that have about 200+ miles on them after at most 35 miles, most of the wear was from one hike/run, plus the feet were killing me from the strike toe strike area really not doing much absorption. I can't see why these are rated so high, I wish I could have my money back, total waste... These were a total let down. They might be fine for someone lighter and less aggressive on the gnarly stuff but for my use, these are terrible. I did my due diligence and am hoping to save someone else with similar needs the loss of precious funds...\n",
    "My wife says that they are very comfortable.  Exactly what to expect from Clarks shoes, except they are sandals.  She want another pair for next summer...\n",
    "Great shoe!  Can wear it casual, or dressy.\n",
    "I was excited to try them on. They were great, fit great, look great. Just at first some letters were written on the frame that wouldnt come off. Until i emailed the company. It came off right away with warm water.\n",
    "Love them and have had them before so I know to order the larger size, so they fit as expected 😀<br /><br />They definitely help my posture and I feel the tingly sensation sooner when walking from using more muscles.\n",
    "Puma is the Only Shoe I have ordered from Amazon, that seems to fit the almost right way. Others are too big...<br />Amazon Boots fit just right and seem to be the only Shoe that can be ordered and fits correctly.<br />I don't know what has happened to the American  / European Shoe Industry in the last 10 to 20 years, shoes seem to not be sized correctly anymore.<br />Maybe the only shoes that are sized correctly are Cement now a days.<br />I recommend not buying shoes at all off of Amazon unless you want to become a Buyer for Crossroads or Goodwill.\n",
    "Good buy! This bag's nice... although it's a little smaller than what I expected.\n",
    "A little small but not to bad. Should have just gone up a size\n",
    "Not 5 stars for the product....the sandals were way too big, but not their fault...but 5 stars for their eventual positive customer attitude. Camel came around to fulfilling my request for a full refund, and they did not require me to return the sandals. All ends well, and I would try again with this vendor.\n",
    "I love love love these sooooooo much!\n",
    "Look very nice with jeans and slacks. They're super comfortable and I got loads of compliments on them. I was a bit concerned that the heel might be s little high and uncomfortable, but they feel good, not too high at all. Very nice shoes. I got them in the black suede too. I'm set for Fall!\n",
    "Just right\n",
    "nice\n",
    "I love these sandals.Just as I expected.\n",
    "fit very nice\n",
    "Good shoes.\n",
    "Pretty on the outside, runs small and very flat with no arch support.  A bit hard to wear.\n",
    "Very fast delivery & I'm happy with the glasses. I am a woman & they are not too masculine. I am still looking for a more feminine pair that are equally dark. These are also not the darkest locs I've ever had, but I like them\n",
    "Love them❤️\n",
    "i love it too very much\n",
    "These are great the fit was amazing & not sure how but crocs are so comfortable & durable. Highly recommended for those who have boys that are very harsh on their foot ware. These particular ones I paid $22 so for the price there are unbeatable\n",
    "Very light weight, dressy looking..\n",
    "Very light weight and comfortable to wear.\n",
    "Good sturdy frames, they don't feel cheaply made.  I just wish the lenses were a little darker.  It's kind of hard to tell from the pics online.  I still wear them when I'm out.\n",
    "Overall comfortable sandal. Just a little wide. I actually have 3 other colors. They don't have an arch support, but they didn't' make my arches hurt either.\n",
    "Great shoes for a great price.  This is the second pair I've bought of this style.  I wear them without socks & would recommend the same.  These shoes are attention grabbers, as I receive a lot of compliments.\n",
    "Arrived on time. Packaged well. Very satisfied with product.\n",
    "Love the look - was surprised at how narrow these ones fit this time - I always buy 8 1/2 addidas - got 2 different pairs - the others fit perfect (powerblaze running shoe) and these will stretch but I they were tight and left my feet sore after day 1 - day 2 was better.\n",
    "Cute and decent quality, but runs about a half size small.\n",
    "Got these shoes just before we went out West and put a lot of walking miles on them.  Very comfortable and great value and price.\n",
    "I love these shoes. I originally had the same pair but I lost one while hiking through a creek. They're super comfy. The only negative thing I would say is don't wear them when it rains you will most likely slip and fall .\n",
    "will keep purchasing Betsey Johnson\n",
    "Fit well\n",
    "comfortable sandals\n",
    "They're really cool.\n",
    "Bigger than case for Costa Fisch glasses case I replaced.\n",
    "I have very flat feet and would have extreme pain for a day or two after doing TKD.  With these shoes, I immediate felt a huge difference and I know I can do TKD for years now!  Because of the different material on the sole, it has taught me to rotate better on my feet and allows me to be more aggressive with my actions!  This was the best purchase I ever could have dreamed of for TKD.<br /><br />If you have arch problems or pain, buy these shoes, you won't be disappointed.\n",
    "Wish I knew about this things back in the day. Been using for the past few months now and even after extensive use of some of my cleats and indoor soccer shoes, they smell as new as they were on the first day. Just put in there after done playing and leave there until next time.\n",
    "look beautiful ..I'm very happy\n",
    "Really Like The Shoes..\n",
    "In love! These fit like a glove, are light weight and super comfortable.  First time I wore these shoes was a day of walking and standing at a sporting event.  My feet felt great.  Looking forward to wearing them to Disneyland! Great buy!\n",
    "I haven't worn Contemporas for years, but I thought I'd try a pair when I saw the price. Unfortunately, they run a little narrower than I remember and I had to send the C width shoes back.<br /><br />Some sizing feedback for those who don't live a dancewear store stocking this shoe in your size: the shoe length was true to sizing guidelines (subtract 2.5 from your street shoe size) - I wear a women's 11 and size 8.5 pointes were the correct length. If you wear a medium width but larger shoe size, I would recommend trying the D width instead of the C width.\n",
    "my cousin love it...\n",
    "Glasses arrived broken. And on top of this, they are very large, more so than you'd think from looking at the picture. I also have my doubts about them being polarized.\n",
    "I give this product a ten on comfort and a three on style.  I have arthritis and fibromyalgia so walking can be extremely painful.  After tearfully saying goodbye to my high heals these were recommended to me by several people. They feel like walking on air. They are the only shoes that do not bother my hip and knee pain, but actually help it.  Now the down side is they are not exactly stylish or cute.  I feel like an old lady in these.  I wish they would make some other more up to date stylish options with the same comfort level.  I have bought the boat shoes they make with the yoga material inside, and while not uncomfortable these go walk shoes are way more comfortable.\n",
    "I gave three stars because even though they pook great the size isnt the same as your usual shoes. And they didn't mention this. If you buy it get a pair 0.5 size higher than usual.\n",
    "I select my size very carefully, still it was quite small. My foot could not fit, if it did it was forcefully. I was very upset upon buying something from amazon to wear and it was horrible size wise. Disappointed.\n",
    "Hi I will like to return this item.  It's not the red Ecco. i got 2 sets  its so hard its not the real ecco this are made in china   1 i still have in box cant use it\n",
    "Loved these shoes. I have some similar, made by other brands, but these are way more comfortable and look better on my feet. A great choice.\n",
    "Good quality\n",
    "My son loves his new Jordan's.\n",
    "Usually ordered the pro grid but tried these and regret it. The others are better. Got blisters and my leg hurt a lot after walking half an hour.\n",
    "Very comfortable for a few hours, apparently not good to walk in them all day with a short break in period as I did get a blister on my toe and soreness on the outside of my feet near the back strap where the support is either a bit high or not wide enough for my foot. Hoping they will become more comfortable as I wear them more often for shorter periods of time. Normally wear a size 6.5, went with a 7 - the straps are made of a soft material and are very comfortable -  not too loose for being a half size bigger as they are adjustable.\n",
    "Boots are amazing, they fit perfectly and feel great with the extra padding provided with order.\n",
    "Wore them to work right after I opened them out of the box and was very impressed. They're cute and casual and I adore them.\n",
    "Nice to walk around d mall with\n",
    "She loved it.\n",
    "I receive compliments daily!\n",
    "Adaorable\n",
    "It's my fault, I should have ordered a 13.  They are too narrow, too small and I normally 11.5 and figured the 12 would be nice.  If you wear anything above a 10.... just get the 13.  They are constructed really well and I did manage to wear them for a few hours while in Ecuador as inside shoes.  But I left them there with a friend who wears size 10 and they fit him perfect.<br /><br />If they had fit like they were supposed to, I would have loved them.  I would have returned them too, but they were a last minute item for my trip and then I left them behind as a gift.\n",
    "I loved the feel, look, and color of these shoes, but I had to send them back. Im waiting for a larger size to arrive. I ordered a 1/2 size down after reading the reviews....but I couldn't even get them on! I ordered a 1/2 size larger this time, and am hoping they fit!!! Update: the second pair arrived,..and one shoe felt 1/2 size tighter than the other. ...but I kept them. Sadly after paying $46 here, I saw them at TjMax for $29\n",
    "I usually wear Skechers Go Walk shoes. The Crocs aren't as &#34;cushy&#34;, but they're very light and comfortable, and don't look quite as &#34;old lady&#34; as the Go Walk.\n",
    "Good product. .\n",
    "To small\n",
    "Love them. At times they are too dark for some conditions,\n",
    "Very cute and good quality! I only don't give it 5 stars because it doesn't have a side pocket to put a water bottle.\n",
    "my sister loves these\n",
    "I was hoping to love these, but I'm not sure quite yet. Something felt odd about the toebox, as if it were a bit wide and tall.\n",
    "Love these Birks!\n",
    "Great boots.\n",
    "look and feel cheap.  The previous HD Sunglasses I purchased at less than 50% less expensive were much bettor.<br /><br />These were sunglasses NOT SHOES!\n",
    "They provide a 1/2 day of comfort!\n",
    "I LOVE these shoes. They're a little big, but that's my own fault. I have changing feet that could be either a 7 or 7.5 on any given day. Either way, they're INCREDIBLY comfortable.\n",
    "So far so good. ..\n",
    "Love the shoes and fits as expected\n",
    "Was used\n",
    "Great shoes.  I like them on runs, walks, etc.  They get a bit dirty since they're all black, but I would buy them again.  I'm 170 pounds and I like to run/walk 3-5 miles a day about 3-5 days a week.\n",
    "very pleased\n",
    "Fits too close to my eyebrows.\n",
    "Diva SHOES :-)\n",
    "This was the right size- Will fit perfect after the break in period.<br /><br />The shoe sizes for the U.S. market should be labeled for the U.S. market\n",
    "Best value sunglasses ever. Just wish the branding was better, my wife looked at me weird when she read the name on the side of the glasses.\n",
    "Love them all - just like family members\n",
    "They look great and fit as expected.  Snug right at first then broke in nicely.\n",
    "I love crocs that is why I am giving 4 stars, but there is something odd about this style. It is somewhat narrow and long and this is not made for wide feet. I hope they make half sizes for this model.\n",
    "Very sexy shoe. A show stopper. Fits perfectly!\n",
    "Absolutely like these shoes. Very lite and comfortable.\n",
    "I keep buying the same shoe. I love them for tennis on clay courts.\n",
    "LOVED THEM !!\n",
    "Comfortable and fit as expected\n",

    "The shoes are true to the size. My boys love them.  I will buy them again!!\n",
    "nice looking comfortable shoes\n",
    "After reading some of the reviews I was a little concerned about ordering these shoes but the 7.5N fit perfectly. I wear them three or four times a week for about 12 hours at a time. I have no issues and feel they look great! I have a difficult time finding narrow shoes. These fit and I am getting many compliments on them.\n",
    "They fit my daughter perfectly and she loves them for gym class.\n",
    "I only get Stride Rite shoes for my son and as always they are the best!\n",
    "It's a little bit on the chunky side ! But other than that fits well !\n",
    "They were to small and narrow... Have been shipped back\n",
    "Love them. Very cute\n",
    "Very good,quality is awesome<br />Bought it for someone she absolutely love it,no regrets,shipping on time\n",
    "These look great and are very well constructed, but the temples are far too short.\n",
    "I bought these to look smarter and I like the slightly hipster look compared to the other set I bought haha. Works a treat- people take me much more seriously, plus when I put them on I know it's business time!\n",
    "It fulfills the purpose I purchased it for (my tablet)\n",
    "Great convenient reading glasses. I have these things taped on the back of my iPhone 6+ and find it extremely useful in situations where I need a quick assist with reading restaurant menus or just a quick read of somethings. My friends liked it so much, now I've ordered 5 more for them.\n",
    "great for the price. wish they were more durable\n",
    "Came very quickly. Perfect. Thank you!\n",
    "Newton makes very good shoes for someone looking to improve their running form by making you strike on the midfoot.  I've been running in them for about 3 weeks, and still feel soreness in my calves, but I can also feel those muscles strengthening, and I notice a change in my stride when I run in other shoes as well.  The shoes themselves don't make you faster, but they help you to become a better runner.  I have the Gravity and the Distance.  Ironically, the Gravity is designed for longer distances than the Distance (poor name choice IMO).  The Gravity is a little heavier and made of more cushioned, durable material than the Distance.  I like both.  I'll probably wear the Gravity in an upcoming marathon and use the Distance for track running and 5-10K runs.\n",
    "I have two in different colors and like the convenience of having my hands free, nice back packs.....\n",

    "Very sexy looking shoes.  I get copliments whenever I wear them\n",
    "IS GOOD THANKS\n",
    "Great fit easy on the toes\n",
    "So far after taking them out on an arduous 10 mile hike, I would say these boots will hold up quite well and last for the long haul. Now this Is preliminary and if time dictates that the quality is not as perceived I will amend my review accordingly. I am looking forward to testing out how well they hold out water and how comfortable they'll be on ever longer hikes but for a short but hard trek, they did the job and handled the varying terrain (mostly rocky) quite well. I am pleased with this purchase and I would recommend these to other hikers or outdoor enthusiasts.\n",
    "Most comfortable shoes ever. I get asked about them all the time.\n",
    "Great\n",
    "Very well\n",
    "I had a pair before these ones & they were much better. I don't car for them, they are comfortable for easy & short word periods but I'm a waitress & work long, hard hours & they can't keep up..\n",
    "Nice shoes wore these for 2 days and I have received so many complainants on these. The Royal blue is better than what I expected and the fit is perfect.\n",
    "I love my shoes thanks\n",
    "I love these shoes.  I normally wear a 6.5 or 7, ordered a 7, but they were too small.  Exchanged them for a 7.5 and they are perfect.  They have been my summer go to shoe.  They are comfortable and I have tossed them in the washer a number of times and they still look great.  Wish I could afford to have a pair in every color.  The exchange process with Amazon was extremely easy.  No complaints.\n",
    "They are costume boots. What does this mean? Not much in way of support and the exterior around the ankle collapses just like the image. Also, the zippers are touchy, so no being rough with them. For the price, they are exactly what you would expect. I plan on wearing these for a number of outings, not just once, and they will handle that just fine. I've used other Funtasma boots and they are still going strong after dozens of uses and miles of walking. I put in my own supports, so they feel just fine on my feet after a couple hours of wear and really, that is a necessity. If you are looking for inexpensive costume boots, Funtasma is the standard. If you want something better, expect to spend a lot more money.\n",
    "So comfortable. And also machine washable.\n",
    "I love the shoe, color and style\n",
    "they are just ok\n",
    "Just a wee small in width but stretched out into a comfy fit. All in all a nice looking comfy shoe\n",
    "Too small so I had to send it back.\n",
    "I have been looking  for a comfortable pair of sandals since my old bass sandals wore out after 20 years. Changing to Taos brand was<br />a leap of faith. I put these on and said &#34;I can't believe I paid this much for a pair of sandals, but if they last they are worth every penny!&#34;<br />So comfortable. I love the support, the soft lining. My only concern is that they are made in China. (Stamped on sandal) Because I am in another industry in which China is a big competitor I am familiar with  the standards and quality control of China being less uniform and consistent, so  I reserve my judgement on their durability. I will check back in a year to comment on how well they hold up. For now, I am wearing them almost everyday. My feet are so happy!\n",
    "Great little boots!\n",
    "Even though I do like these shoes, they are a little heavy. I bought these for my little guy who has very 'chubby' feet. The multiple straps are perfect at securing the shoes to his feet. However, he is learning to walk with shoes and I just feel that these shoes are a little heavy. I worry that that might be an issue with the learning process.\n",
    "They look like used sandal, the gold surface was peeled since first time wearing.\n",
    "Help me a lot with my plantar fasciitis problem\n",
    "I love these shades\n",
    "These are comfortable and look good.  Fairly breathable, and no rough spots on the interior.  Break-in time was zero.  They just slip on and wear well.  I've walked around all day and have no problems.\n",
    "Yea these shoes are very small size 11. Is like a 9 1/2 first time i got riped off from useing amazon. I threw them on wore the my faught just now im stuk with closet shoes.\n",
    "I like a lot\n",
    "nice\n",
    "Very good looking shoes.  They might be better suited for people with thin feet.  If possible order it in a wider size than you usually wear.\n",
    "[[ASIN:B0128NXBJI Rocks Eyewear - Emerald Yellow - Made in Italy - Men & Women Sunglasses]] I ordered this in yellow for my boyfriend as a gift. It looks great and stylish! He loves how lightweight it is, and how the bright & cool the reflective yellow color is! The quality of both the rim and the lenses are also good. The black rim is flexible all around and has this cool, matte feel to it. We also both think it feels incredible on your face. The UV protection is excellent for the lenses and I don't get a weird glare from the sunlight as you do with some cheaper glasses. Definitely also perfect for a sporty look/style.  To Summarize: -Great value for money. The quality all around is excellent. -The style and fit is excellent. -It's lightweight and flexible. Feels cool to touch and feels great when on your face. -UV protection and visibility through the lenses are awesome -Love the bright reflective color\n",
    "Love these.. but they do have one flaw.. You can not wash them they fall apart quickly once you do.\n",
    "Everything is great! Arrived within 15 days. All things are the same as showed in a picture,just the color i want. Plenty of card slots for my card and enough space for my cash.\n",
    "all good\n",
    "I was tempted to buy a pair of Vans or Chuck's, but after reading the reviews on amazon as well finding out that Mark Bell 'powerlifter' was involved in the design of these Crossfit Lite TR's...I had to give the shoes a try.  Surprisingly the design of the foot-bed has more cushion than I expected for a fairly flat surface shoe.  They use Ortholite insoles so it's not uncomfortable at all, at least for a few hours of use at a time.  These were designed for powerlifting...not Olympic weightlifting, there is a difference.<br /><br />I have fairly flat feet and noticed most arched supported shoes don't help me in staying 'grounded' to the floor when performing squats, deadlifts or even leg presses.  I bought Asics wrestling shoes to get a more flat feel to my stance and they helped when using them on legs days but they still were 'too' flexible for my taste.  Although, I 'm not sure how these will do during calf exercises due to the stiffness of the soles.  Again, don't expect very much arch support...not the intent of these shoes.<br /><br />These Crossfit Lite TR's covers the best of my needs in a powerlifting shoe.  They fit perfectly...<br />*The best 'grounding' feeling of stability and great heel support<br />*The larger toe box was genius, most tennis type shoes tend to be tight for me<br />*Not a very heavy shoe at all, very comfortable\n",
    "nice and comfortable\n",
    "I was very hesitant on buying Chacos because they are pretty expensive. I caught them on a sale so I couldn't pass them up. I bought them bc we are going on a cruise soon, and I wanted a sturdy sandal that I could wear at the ports. I usually can wear anywhere between a 8.5 - 9.5 size shoe, so I ordered a 9 thinking it would be fine. They ended up being a little too big, so I plan on sending them back and getting an 8. The little bit of walking I did around the house just to see how they felt proved to me that Chacos are worth it. Super comfortable. I just wish that they weren't sliding off of my foot! No compaints, but half sizes would be awesome though.\n",
    "So comfortable!!!\n",
    "Good bargain.  Timely delivery.  Quality shoe.\n",
    "Nice looking glasses its a gift for  someone and hope they like it too.\n",
    "Snug to start and broke in nicely.\n",
    "My little girl loves those shoes, of course everyone wears them these days. Because they are cut out more than the boy kind, these don't stay on her feet as good as they should. We decided to buy some other shoes meanwhile so she can grown into those.\n",
    "The design and the quality look excellent. the boat is not so heavy as expected.\n",
    "I love the color and design. It's not my first Dansko pair and I expected some break-in period. This pair was pretty comfortable from the get go, except for the top of the shoe still is tight on my foot (the part that goes right over the highest point of the foot rise (thus is 4 stars).\n",
    "these shoes are great i ordered a second pair for a friend\n",
    "Perfect fit as I expected. Good quality shoe.\n",
    "they are a little smaller than expected for width.  I would order a size larger next time.  Very comfortable\n",
    "These shoes are super cute and much safer than cheap child flip flops. My daughter has worn them almost every day this past summer.  I love the Croc material as it is durable and comfortable to wear. My daughter did get an odd blister on her big toe from it rubbing, but she also walks more on her toes so I think she was putting too much pressure in that one location.\n",
    "I don't ever write reviews normally.  But I was hesitant to buy this online because I like to try my shoes on before I buy them.  Well if your looking at this boot online chances are you either heard about it being great or bought it for yourself and found out.  Instantly comfortable, very durable and exacting fit.  I wear a 13 EE and usually the chances of me finding that at a retail store are slim to zero.  These fit even better then the ones I bought at a sporting goods store several years ago.<br /><br />If your are thinking about buying a great set of boots online I highly suggest you check these guys out.  Great service fast shipping A+++. Thanks\n",
    "my 8th pair\n",
    "Good price for a good shoe.  It was 50% off!\n",
    "I love these! I bought them for myself (female adult) because I thought they were cool and if I fits, I wear its. They are comfortable but a little high cut because it's right on the edge of my ankle bone and over my Achilles so it's rubbing and bending when I walk, causing blisters. I'm hoping that'll go away once I've worn them out.<br />Love that they light up in the dark so my friends can find me when we're out :)\n",
    "very uncomfortable\n",
    "Just as advertised, great service\n",
    "Freakin cool!! I love it :p\n",
    "I adore these boots. They're the only thing my daughter wore for the first year of her life. They stay on her feet, while looking completely adorable. Totally worth the $!\n",
    "I just received these shoes so I have no idea how well they will hold up but for now they are my favorite walking shoes. Extremely comfortable, easy slip on and off, these are my go to shoes for everything but work. Very light, the cushioned inside is awesome. I walked a trail in these bad boys and despite the rocks, roots, and sticks, I hardly felt anything but cushion. I really hope they last a while.\n",
    "Awesome shoes! So comfortable & no blisters, they wear & wore nicely all day at school ;-)\n",
    "The shoes were just a tad snug at the big toe and the color is more silver than expected. overall a nice looking & feeling shoe.\n",
    "I have terrible neuropathy from back surgery that affects my legs and feet terribly.  We went on holiday recently and I was terrified that I would be in terrible pain and would be unable to do all the walking our holiday would require.  Plus, they are pretty.  These were a God-send for me.  For days and days these sandals kept my feet walking and nearly pain free.  Now I need to find something to wear for the winter months.  Thanks Aetrex!\n",
    "Pretty flats,  a little stiff out of the box but awesome otherwise. My kid hates shoes but managed to keep these on for a couple of hours before flinging them under the table at a wedding.\n",
    "I am very pleased with my new coach sunglasses. They are the perfect weight and fit . And best of all they were reasonably priced .\n",
    "Love it\n",
    "I've been wearing some variation of Ecco's Track 6 shoe for over 10 years now - this is my 5th pair - and they have been consistently great shoes. I'm pretty rough on them, so while my older pairs are &#34;cosmetically distressed,&#34; they are otherwise as comfortable and as serviceable as they were they day I got them. Highly recommended.\n",
    "Returned them - they run at least a size small.\n",
    "Great\n",
    "Very Comfortable\n",
    "My favorite shoes. Very comfortable, very stylish, and I will definitely be buying more in the future. Expensive price tag is totally worth it. Ive had mine for years and they're still holding up very well\n",
    "Really cute shoes\n",
    "I bought these for my son's 18th birthday and he absolutely loved them.  Very quick service.\n",
    "THEY RAN TOO SMALL. I'VE BEEN BUYING THEM FOR 4 YEARS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHANGED, I'M 62 YEARS OLD SO I KNOW IT'S NOT MY FOOT. I WANT TO EXCHANGE THEM FOR A LARGER SIZE. I WORE THE ONE PAIR TODAY. I LOVE YOUR BOOTS USUALLY. USE THEM FOR WORK AND HIKING.\n",
    "So small that I can't wear them. There is no return information from this seller so I do not recommend this product.\n",
    "Very Bad, Its quality is very poor,Let me Very disappointed\n",
    "Fit perfect, comfortable for hiking and spending all day on your feet!\n",
    "I like the feel of the bumps inside, kinda massages your feet while wearing and walking in 'em. personally, not for all day wear for me, but that's probably relative to the wearer as most things are.\n",
    "A bit smaller than same size bought before, toe straps somewhat tight also. Working them in\n",
    "Very cute, but large on my 14mo. She's in the 50% for height and weight, so average sized baby, but these won't fit her for awhile.\n",
    "I love Toms and the order was shipped very quickly\n",
    "fit, design and finishing are very good. I gave four stars because I did expected it genuine suede leather.\n",
    "So far so good. Very comfortable, they don't hug your face so a little air can circulate in there. Seem wider than most so would be good on larger faces.\n",
    "perfect!\n",
    "Superb comfort.  Look even better in person.\n",
    "Fits well just as seem very pretty and comfy.I love every thing about this shoe.\n",
    "already returned it\n",
    "Bought because size said 3.1 inch but was only 2 -5/8 inch. Kept because my roommate wanted one and 2 5/8 was ok\n",
    "With too low a heel, they come off very easily. They do have a good non skid sole but tend to fall off unless you pick your foot straight up when moving forward.\n",
    "great\n",
    "I've owned these for a period of almost two years and they look great, which speaks for the quality of the design and materials. However, there are two slight issues that work themselves into one: sole wear and traction in wet/slipper surfaces (hence the 4 stars). There isn't any, even from the start. You'll quickly find yourself ice skating in restrooms, marble floors, and puddles.\n",
    "This bag is more beautiful in person.<br />Sparkles like diamonds under light. Perfect size. Comes with optional shoulder chain or smaller handle chain.<br />Very pleased.\n",
    "Really like it, great style and most comfortable touch.\n",
    "Fit perfect , great quality , really like the style\n",
    "Good quality shoes for my son's High school uniform\n",
    "I absolutely LOVE these shoes.  I bought them for Beach Body's T25 which is a lot of jumping and lateral movements, and they have far exceeded my expectations.  They are a great shoe and this was an excellent price.\n",
    "Super comfy!\n",
    "Great Kate Spade look! Gift for my sister - she loves them!\n",
    "Perfect.\n",
    "When I went to the local shoe stores to figure out my son's shoe size, which is a 14 in the other shoes. I ordered that size. When they arrived, he tried them on and they barely fit.\n",
    "I have owned these in the past and loved them.  They changed the shoes though, I had to buy an entire size larger then the pair I got last year\n",
    "fits perfectly\n",
    "Very nice\n",
    "good\n",
    "These are so cute!  I ordered up 1/2 size like reviews said, however, for my foot, looks like I need a full size up.  So I just returned these and ordered another pair.  Very cute, light and stylish, I can't wait for me new pair!\n",
    "Great, half eye you can stick in your pocket\n",
    "These are the most comfortable cleats I've ever worn!!\n",
    "WONDERFUL FUZZIES\n",
    "Great product for the price! Love the set of threes, because he is always losing them. My husband has a large head and it's sometimes hard to find glasses that fit... These are perfect\n",
    "I ordered the green, pink & black in size 8. The green & pink fit fine but the black was easily 1 size too large. Seems the black run larger so be mindful if you order the black. The shoes do smell but after awhile the odor goes away. The smell is not as bad as people say. I love the shoes. They are super cute. They are completely flat though, so not the best thing for your feet. I'm going to put shoe insoles in them to give them some arch support.\n",
    "They are cheaply made, I won't wear them outside in the winter as I think my feet will get too cold since these are not made with leather.\n",
    "My only problem with them is that the surface finish of the shoes has started to peel off.\n",
    "Very comfortable and cute!\n",
    "Love it. The perfect size.\n",
    "The ankle strap was tight, the heel strap rubbed a blister\n",
    "These booties were a gift to my daughter.  She loves them!  She is a teacher on her feet all day, and they are very comfortable.\n",
    "Excellent travel bag\n",
    "Looks good with everything. Lightweight makes it especially comfortable and possible to wear all day. Love the height, and because of the platform you don't feel it when you're wearing them.\n",
    "Great look and wonderful price!\n",
    "Love the feel of this shoe, I have used them to walk outside and they are very comfortable.\n",
    "Shoes run large. Had to return them\n",
    "Better than as pictured. Comfortable for long wear. Warm. Versatile style. Order a size up, however. I'm a 10 and needed an 11.\n",
    "Did not like them\n",
    "Love them!\n",
    "Very comfortable! Love these shoes.\n",
    "The foot fitter worked ok and as expected. The insertion buttons seem to by a kind of plastic rather than a sturdier material like aluminum or something. Other than this it is easy to use.<br />Fast shipping\n",
    "Very cheap looking.  The lighter color on the pair I got looked like it had been painted in.  There were what looked like brush lines and dots/streaks of darker brown throughout the lighter leather.  Very disappointed.\n",
    "it's a great boot, not one complaint.been wearing Wolverine boots now for maybe 10 or more years.\n",
    "They were cheap and not at all what I was expecting. No sparkles and badly made\n",
    "I wear a 12.5, one of the half sizes that is difficult to find.  These fit perfectly and were comfortable from the first day they arrived. I walk on gravel daily at work and needed a trailer runner to avoid tracking rocks into the office. Some shoes claiming to be trail runners will pick up rocks and mud in the tread, these have the proper tread design to avoid picking up debris. They have a little extra support towards the outside of the foot that might not be for everyone, but is what I needed.\n",
    "Comfortable shoes but be aware that a 14 shoe is 49 cm, instead of 48 like some other shoe manufacturers.\n",
    "too large\n",
    "Got this shoe in the off white and they are truly beautiful. Comfortable and classy and the heel height is perfect. well made and good quality leather. Very happy with this purchase.\n",
    "My son loves this slide. It's the only type he will wear and I was happy to find it on Amazon!\n",
    "Beautiful shoe. True to size. Buy it\n",
    "Love these shoes!\n",
    "These shoes are beautiful. The shoes were delivered when they said they would be delivered.\n",
    "I wear an 7.5/8.0<br />I bought these in an 8.5 becuase the other ratings noted a smaller size. They were right. These boots are tight around the toes (actually pretty much just overall to small) and have absolutely no support, making them very uncomfortable.<br />I do like the style of them though, even if the material kinda feels like spray fainted foam.\n",
    "Great product. Fits as expected.\n",
    "Cutest shoes ever with all the bling my granddaughter needs to top off her outfits.\n",
    "Received my Clarks boots in Navy and am trying to decide whether to keep them or not. I wear a 7 and a half and they fit fine<br />with a tall knee sock and my jeans. They come to about 2&#34; below my knee and I 'am 5'2&#34;. I do have room to wear a thicker sock<br />in the winter as the toe box is big enough with out pinching my toes.<br />They look like a rubber winter boot and that is what I don't like. It says they are leather but just don't look like it. I wanted a dress<br />leather navy boot.<br />I will probably keep them because they have a big restocking fee if I send them back, and were very reasonable in price. We have a long winter here in Va, so can use them in the snow.<br />I guess I will try for a more dressy navy leather one and make sure I read the return policy first.\n",
    "I have been a big fan of the Vigor series. I have owned several pairs with no complaints. One of the best trail running shoes you can buy for the money my opinion. I have run multiple 50K races with my Vigors and they have done great. I have tried other trail running shoes that cost well over $100 and have been disappointed. Just remember to order 1/2 size up from your typical size.\n",
    "I love these sunglasses.  They are sturdy and well made but not &#34;heavy&#34;.  Plus they look good!\n",
    "The color is very beautiful, I like it very much!\n",
    "The sandals are OK and the price I paid was terrific!  I am not able to close them as tightly as I really need.\n",
    "I ordered Wide and receiver Medium width.\n",
    "very comfortable\n",
    "The Roxanne Crochet Flats are so comfortable and cute.  They have a rubber sole and are in a crochet type pattern that has a metallic finish to it.  They work perfect for tons of my outfits since I ordered the Natural flats.  I ordered size 7 and I usually wear a size 7.5 and they fit perfect.  I was really worried that they would be tight since 7 is not my usual size but that is not the case at all.  I am really happy with these and I am happy that I received this product at a discount for my unbiased and honest review.\n",
    "I expected the shoes to be wide---Foreign shoes don't use narrow for width.<br />These shoes look great.\n",
    "Pretty great shoes for the price. I can't complain that much. The only thing i would change about these is that I wish that it would envelop my ankle a bit more because it's pretty out there.\n",
    "Cute shoes.  Fit as your would expect a higher heeled shoe - easy to walk in with block heel, though.\n",
    "Great fit, good price! No need to break them in!!\n",
    "Very sharp looking shoe\n",
    "I received a pair of these for Christmas and loved them so I purchased another pair , very good arch support.\n",
    "These are not Non-Slip. I work them to work (a restaurant kitchen with tile floors) and slide all over the place.\n",
    "pretty and comfortable.\n",
    "Thesea are awesome. Purchased for my 6 year old as part of his school uniform. They look stylish but most importantly they are comy enough for recess.\n",
    "Adorable,...great fit. I love these shoes!!!\n",
    "These shoes were for my son for his new job.  He says they are a bit too tight, but hoping that is just because they are new and need to be broken in a little.  Also, he is not use to a job where he has to be on his feet all day.  They do look very good though.\n",
    "I love my Cat face zipper bag coin bag. I have no idea why I got questions pertaining to shoes when this is a coin bag....lol!\n",
    "This design is the the best i ever tried<br />The problem is decreasing availabelity in the market i am afried price will shoot up\n",
    "I usually wear a 10 or 10.5, and, of course, you can't get 10.5.  So I thought that since these shoes had a strap, an 11 would be just fine.  And, they are.  I think they are true to size.  They are VERY wide, though.  Again, since they have a strap, they work for me.  Some might not like the look since they are so wide.  There is a pattern on the inside sole.  My sister tried them on and she couldn't stand that feeling under her foot.  It doesn't bother me.  I've gotten lots of compliments on them--maybe because they are red?\n",
    "did not like the fit of this shoe. I was quite disappointed. maybe i will try another version but this one I did not like\n",
    "Authentic , elegant and classy . I'm very happy with it . It will meet your expectations and more .\n",
    "Item came on time and as expected.  They run small, one size larger than I normally wear fit perfect.  They are good looking shoes and displace water very well.  No complaints thus far.\n",
    "I tried these on at a store before buying to make sure I ordered the correct size. My feet are a size 9.5-10US, so I tried both the UK7 and UK8. The 7s were very snug and would be more difficult to break in, while the 8s were a bit roomy, even with thick socks. I have narrow feet, and the soles are not too loose. I decided on getting mine in a size UK8. Also, they arrived 2 days before the earliest estimated delivery date. Overall I am very pleased, I only wish these were produced in 1/2 sizes.\n",
    "I wear them around the house all day long.  My heel pain is gone.  Love these slippers.\n",
    "This was a pleasant surprise. Shoes are comfortable. I got a size 11 patent black (I'm usually a size 10, but I heeded everyone's warnings.) It's comfortable and the shape of the shoe is fairly flattering.\n",
    "These are great!  I bought for the fall...\n",
    "So much yes.\n",
    "love love love them!\n",
    "very  nice\n",
    "These are too tight in the toe area and I wish to send them back.\n",
    "My daughter loves them. Great school shoes.\n",
    "Love them! Very comfortable.\n",
    "My 6yr old boy loves it.  So far I will definitely say it was a great buy for the price.\n",
    "best &#34;flops&#34; ever.  Love Reef Flip Flops and wish I had a pair of every color.\n",
    "Great shoes!\n",
    "I loved these sandals but the fit felt at least a size off. The fact that the front strap can't be adjusted was the deal breaker for me. I''d have ordered the next size down but none were available. I'd say unless you're on the large end of the size order down one size. Returned them :(\n",
    "its a nice fit.<br />fast shipping!\n",
    "Excelent\n",
    "These boots are great. The color is one of those that goes so well with so much, the style is fantastic and they look great with jeans. My only wish is that they were real leather.\n",
    "Very durable.  I like them a lot.  Good for hiking and stuff.  My wife even lets me wear them in public :)\n",
    "Perfect\n",
    "Hi, I'm enjoying my comfortable flip flop green sandal. Thank you.\n",
    "Love them\n",
    "My son loves the comfort these bring to his football games.\n",
    "Very good\n",
    "Overall a good looking comfortable shoe.  They just ran a bit big so 1/2 size smaller would have been perfect!\n",
    "These shoes are absolutely excellent. It's the second pair that I've bought on the last two years. The first pair still looks incredible after being used about once or twice a week during the warm months of the year. The soles are very well made, and you can clearly tell the shoe is of high quality. I highly recommend it.\n",
    "Beautiful sunglasses looksize exactly like the pictures shown.\n",
    "A lot more comfortable than expected. My only issue, and this is small, is that the bottom of the insert should be more textured. They sometimes slide around when you're putting you shoes on.\n",
    "My second pair.  Love them.\n",
    "love! super comfy\n",
    "Runs small. Need to order a size bigger\n",
    "I was replacing a pair I've had for years and ta-da - the new ones are exactly like the old, finally worn out pair!  Consistency is so satisfying!!\n",
    "Came right on time, I love them!\n",
    "I have no problems with these shoes. Very comfortable.\n",
    "Love these! For the price, they're fantastic and I wear them with everything!\n",
    "i only gave &#34;somewhat small&#34; since they do run small but i had read all the comments for this and bought a 1/2&#34; size larger so that i would fit perfectly. buy a little larger so that you can fit easily.<br /><br />GREAT for weight lifting since it balances you perfectly, BUT not so great for running.\n",
    "Own 2 pair Aetrex shoes  both very comfortable and supportive  probably could wear all day just have not tried\n",
    "Perfect for my daughters first tap shoes, great deal.\n",
    "It not that bad!\n",
    "I loved these babes! They fit true to size!\n",
    "The support in these shoes is good. I ordered the wide and they fit perfect. They're very comfortable on my 5 mile walks. Would definitely recommend. I'm giving 4 stars because they seem slightly flimsy, and I'm not sure how long they'll last.\n",
    "Not made to wear all day\n",
    "Very nice bag, but it's more of a raspberry color (was hoping for more of the bright pink in the picture). Very simple with no logos (other reviews have mentioned a logo) and very chic. It doesn't open very wide so it can be hard to fish into the bag to easily grab items. It's the perfect size for me since I like medium size bags rather than large ones.\n",
    "Very Good\n",
    "Great shoe, but they do run small. Suggest a 1/2 size up from your normal.\n",
    "I love these sandals...best I have ever had\n",
    "Beautiflu!!!!!\n",

    "Have had trouble for years finding the right fit due to eee width without spending a lot more than I cared to. These fit like a custom shoe the first time I wore them. Could not recommend them higher for similar shoe needs.\n",
    "Kind of like skinny jeans, many posts mentioned narrow shoe sizes: should have ordered the 2x wide version. Didnt work for me but it could work for you\n",
    "Very pretty but not at all how it appears in the picture. It is not shiny, and the middle bag is flat.\n",
    "This is the way I expected skechers to work.  I love them.  I bought a pair a year ago and they were terrific.  I have 2 jobs that I stand and walk all day, so they are terrific.  I would recommend these to everyone.<br /><br />Thank You\n",
    "Great shoe!\n",

    "I bought these to look smarter and I like the computer techy look compared to the other set I bought haha. Works a treat- people take me much more seriously, plus when I put them on I know it's business time!\n",
    "Love the IC Berlin glasses. They are so well made and versatile but I have the worst luck with them.  I lost these in Hawaii a few months after buying them, which is I think the 4th pair of IC Berlin Shades I've lost. Theyre too expensive for me to keep buying and leaving places, but if you keep better track of your sunglasses than I do, highly recommended.\n",
    "Awesome\n",
    "Very fragile, both pairs I purchased broke with two weeks of wear.\n",
    "strongly recommended for easy-fit and replacement lace.\n",
    "These shoes have been amazing. I work 12 hour shifts and walk between 5-8 miles per shift. These shoes have given my feet a chance to recover from years of were from work boots and working out..<br />I won't go in depth regarding the pros and cons,but I will write this, I've only experienced pros from these shoes thus far.\n",
    "Loved it and the size was just right\n",
    "the straps are snug across the top of the foot the fit and comfort is ok except for that strap. maybe if the velcro and strap was redone the shoe would be more comfortable.\n",

    "I love this wallet so much like words can't even explain\n",
    "I have been wearing these boots for almost 2 weeks. I am a journeyman power lineman and I love these boots. To me there was no break in at all. Love that they are waterproof and steel toe eh rated.\n",

    "Just a little big but not too bad\n",
    "Is the  old design , but is really good the color and the size\n",

    "I'm so glad I found this adorable and high quality sandals for my toddler. The same sandals (but in blue color) cost $55 at Geox store and I was ready to buy them at the store. But because the store doesn't have them in my son's size (5,5) I decided to check Amazon and glad I did. Same shoes but just a different color (red is great color as well) and the price is half off. I couldn't be happier! I love GEOX shoes for my baby boy, it was his first walking shoes. I love Pediped as well but compare to Stride Rite this one (Geox) are much MUCH better. The quality stands by itself, and I love the design and the look of the shoes. Highly recommend, especially if you find a great deal like this one.\n",

    "very narrow. 5.25&#34; / 133.mm width. too bad because they are cute!\n",

    "Just ordered a second pair. Great shoe, great price.\n",
    "Super super cute I love it !\n",

    "Cute. Color just as expected<br />Very cocomfortable\n",
    "Love the shoes\n",
    "These are super cute shoes IF only my 7 year old could get them on her feet. The &#34;stretch laces for easy on & off&#34; do NOT stretch to allow us to even get them on her foot. I think they would fit if we could actually get them past her heel. VERY disappointed.\n",
    "Good comfort fit.\n",
    "these are smaller than the small in dept stores, they areva 52 vs a 55.\n",

    "Love Dansko shoes! Very comfy and offer good support.\n",
    "the best\n",
    "Love these shoes! They are so comfortable! I was looking to replace an old pair.\n",
    "I bought the shoes as new. Don't give me a beat up box someone saved for 10 years, not acceptable. God only knows if they were new or not. If I bought used shoes fine, new not okay.\n",
    "Glasses are amazing. Authentic product, I'm very satisfied!\n",
    "The product is of good quality and description matches well.\n",
    "These shoes are amazingly comfortable!\n",
    "The fit and comfort is great, especially if you have wide feet like I do. However, the shoes are a bit clunky and make it difficult to get a good touch on the ball.\n",
    "these do NOT fit original half jacket frames.\n",
    "Great boot. Delivered a day ahead of scheduled date. The fit is perfect especially when added with a good insole. Only wish could have used more than 1 gift card when ordering and paying.\n",

    "holding up pretty nicely even when wearing often.\n",
    "Love this Flipflops. They fit perfect and look great.\n",
    "Mu husband loves it. He wears it all day at work.\n",

    "I have to say I was a little worried about how these would fit. I have purchased shoes online in the past that have not fit as expected. I put these on and right away was very happy. I don't normally wear flats, but think I have a new favorite shoe. I am on my feet all day long at work. I came home from work and as usually kicked off my shoes, slipped these on and was already happy with my purchase. They fit great, look great, feel great. I love how they look with my jeans, and sure they will look just as good with any other outfit. Now all I need is more colors. I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for a honest review.\n",
    "My 2yr old absolutely loves these shoes! She wants to wear them non-stop.  I think she especially likes that she can put them on herself.  We now have them in blue and pink and get compliments on them every time she wears them. I want a pair for myself!\n",
    "I recommend this shoe to anyone that like a comfortable fitting shoe.\n",
    "Great pen case with rapid  delivery.\n",
    "Great\n",
    "The shoes are too wide and fit more like a 7 than the 5 1-2 that they are.  I see no information on returning them for my refund.  How do I go about that ?  There was no paperwork in the box\n",
    "love them.  repeat order'\n",
    "Very nice ballet shoe but it has a very slick black sole unlike the brown pair I have.  It was too dangerous on carpet and tile which is why I has to return it.\n",
    "I had to go buy inserts because crocs were too large. Too expensive considering total cost for shoes & inserts. Next time, I'll buy them in a store so I can try them on.\n",
    "Great shoe with a lot of support and cushioning. The only disappointment was the sole wear.\n",
    "Almost nothing to these shoes--light and airy. The back of the heel slips a bit in mid-step, maybe because I don't lace them all the way to the last eyelet.\n",
    "I ordered these as a gift and they were about a half size too small, so I exchanged them.  The exchange was 100% hassle-free and the new ones were perfect!  Great for all types of use from casual to sport--we intend to use them kayaking for a lightweight pull-on shoe we can get in the water with if need be.\n",
    "This is my second pair of Clark's flip flops, and I love them. Well-made, comfortable, can walk all day in them.\n",
    "I feel satisfied with these shoes, beautiful and comfortable, thanks\n",
    "I've had this style of Mephisto shoe before and LOVED them.  I ordered up a size from my usual size, but they were still a bit too short, and too narrow.  Too bad, I really wanted to keep them!\n",
    "Love Clarks, another great shoe. Do make sure to give these a nice clean every now and then so they last a while.\n",
    "Great shoes!!\n",
    "WOW these shoes were made for instant comfort and style.  I have worn the khaki shoes and washed them over and over all spring and summer and they are still such great shape.  They look almost new even after months of wearing them often.  I have ordered a second pair for fall.  This is a great shoe if you need to look dressy casual.  I am 63 and loving the comfort!\n",
    "Awesome flip flops.  Can't believe how comfortable they are - the thong is soft material and the flips flops are actually lined with material that has yoga poses.  I've never put anything on my feet that were as dreamy as these.  The Yoga Mat top is like a mattress for your feet you can wear them 24/7.  Because I've been bragging about my new flip flops - I now have orders from my family I have to fill!\n",
    "Best sandals i have owned.\n",
    "Cute boot but it's too large. My daughter is out of a size 3 shoe and going into a size 4, I even went to a shoe store to get her foot measured. Oh well.\n",
    "I often have to &#34;break&#34; these shoes in over several weeks. I was able to immediate start wearing them all day long! Nice fit\n",
    "These boots are great. I wear a 11 1/2 wide all the time, So I ordered these the same. Will say they were a little loose but there is not much padding in the shoe, so I ordered a pair of Dr Scholls inserts and the boot fits perfect, and with the inserts is very comfortable. Very happy with the purchase.\n",
    "NICE!!!<br /><br />New Balance Men's ML565 Classic Running...\n",
    "These sandals do run about a full size small. Meaning an 11 is really a 10. Other than that they felt great right out of the box and seem to be built well.\n",
    "The boot itself is very comfortable, and thats even without the boot liner socks. To me the boot is a little too high but I bought the boot anyway, because I got tired of waiting for the price to go down.\n",
    "A little too tight  Maybe when I break them in\n",
    "A gift to my sister and she loves it as it's very comfortable!\n",
    "True to size. Daughter says it feels good to her feet. Just wish I had order a size bigger to make shoe last longer.\n",
    "My husband ordered these and LOVES them. He had purchased them and then gave them to a family member that liked them. Then he regretted it and missed them. So he bought this pair. He loves the shoes and I ended up buying a pair in the women's. They are a sturdy shoes but not heavy. Great for hiking but I wear them everywhere.\n",
    "For decades Adidas have set the bar on cool. They look great, feel great, are great. From the courts to the comfort of any other surface, Adidas has got you covered. These shoes are no different. Superstar's are the business. The shell toe is highly fashionable and the rest speaks for itself. I opened the box and smiled. I already knew what to expect. I was just grinning because I got them at such a crazy price. Like around $31 with the discount. I couldn't believe it. Shell toes for that price? Wish I could've gotten more.\n",
    "very nice\n",
    "Wish there were more\n",
    "Great fit. Comfortable and Water resistant. Marvelous shoes\n",
    "I love it! Fits perfectly and also comfortable. Nice design for a black pump. I'm glad that I have it.\n",

    "Love Vera Bradley bags. A well constructed bag. However it is a little larger than I like. It does have lots of room for everything. I really appreciate the outter carpartment to hold my tablet. I wish it had another pocket on the other side to put papers.\n",
    "They run large - i wear a 7 - very glad i went with a 6....they fit perfectly.  And - good arch support which is why i bought them.  And - they aren't hideous.\n",
    "My son is very happy with his new cleats.  Very comfortable.\n",
    "Awesome\n",
    "This is a cool bag. It's definitely orange not brown. The leather feels nice though. I hang my bags from the loop at the top and this one came apart after a week. I still love the bag and the store owner was quick to resolve the issue.\n",
    "These are my second pair of ASICS and I love everything them.\n",

    "Not Revo\n",
    "they run small ordered 1/2 size bigger. run narrow cramp up after wearing awhile. hope they will break in? if not out $$$$$\n",
    "i wish more american companies were as consistently dependable as german.\n",
    "good\n",
    "Brown color is darker than picture shows (still nice shade though)... Comfy flip flop. (much more comfortable than Soda brand flip flops!! (If you're browsing/comparing). I hv narrow feet - this flip flop was not snug but not loose either; a good balance. The top part and the toe part are pretty soft... Fits true to size. Enjoy! ^_^\n",
    "Stylish and comfortable for rainy day wear, just what I was looking for!\n",
    "I found these shoes to be the perfect gift for male friends.\n",
    "Awesome!!\n",
    "These are nice, comfy and the colors are vibrant. They also are better than I expected around water, traction is pretty good.\n",
    "Super comphy!\n",
    "While I didn't mind the looks of this shoe, the fit was way off. I got a 9 wide and the toes were fine but the heel was way too loose and the top of the instep was too tight. I'd have to say it was too big AND too small. Very strange. Had to pay return shipping and a restocking fee.\n",
    "I ordered two pair.  Typically, I cannot wear this type of sandal I get a blister or sore between the toes.  This sandal I have walked 3 or more miles in around town on a brisk walk, very comfortable, durable, and soft.  I have scrapped them with our damage and walked in the rain without damage to them.  They fit perfectly and look good on the feet.\n",
    "I love it! Fits and also comfortable. I love the colors of this shoe. I'm glad that I have it.\n",
    "Love this bag!!! So much room!!!! Carrying today...getting a lot of compliments!!!\n",
    "Review questions were about shoes, not a tote.  Didn't  make sense.<br />However, loved the tote but for my use, I exchanged it for a smaller one.  It is sturdy, stands on its own.  There is such a wide variety of sizes and designs.\n",
    "The 6 year old is a big fan.\n",
    "I was looking for walking shoes that are slip-on and these serve the purpose, we are not allowed to wear tennis shoes to work but I go for a 30 minutes walk after lunch every day and I don't want to carry an extra pair of shoes. The description says they are white but they are not, the color of the picture is true. I still want a white pair so I just bought a pair of Sketchers from Amazon, I will write a review on these once I receive and try  to walk in them.\n",
    "Love these boots!! Perfect\n",
    "Awesome shoes ! Had a lot more grey than in the picture !!! But other than that 5stars !\n",
    "Now I know why my son only wears Merrell shoes!!  Just sorry I waited so long to join him.  Seriously, these were comfortable from the moment I removed them from their box!  They may be my first Merrell's but I doubt they will be my last!\n",
    "Ok first they came super quick only like 2 weeks. Heel height is exactly as expected perfect suede. Absolutely in lovee gonna wear them tonight\n",
    "This bag does not accord with the picture, not really leather.\n",
    "my daughter has wide feet and it is sometimes difficult to find shoes that have straps to fit. She was able to wear these shoes for 6 months because of the flexibility of the strap. I try to always buy stride rite for my kids due to the high quality. My daughter was able to wear her shoes to day care and they were still nice enough after 6 months of wear and tear to pass on to a friend.\n",
    "Besides being a bit tight, they're well made. I almost sent them back, but for the price, I figured the few hours here and there I'll wear them, they'll be fine.\n",

    "These hiking shoes were awesome...bought them 1 month before 55+ mile back country hiking trip in Yellowstone.  Very little break-in required.  No blisters or hot spots at all  - performed flawlessly - great grip and not clunky like other hiking shoes.  Recommend getting gaiters with low tops if in muddy conditions.\n",
    "Best shoes I've ever owned\n",
    "I've had my eye on this purse for a long time. It was worth the wait.  It's nice and big, room for all my things and it was shipped in a timely manner.  It's completely authentic and the price was great.\n",

    "l LOVE these shoes. so much so I'm about to buy another pair so I have them for next year.  I wear them ALL the time and am wearing them OUT!!  I have arthritis in my ankle and these shoes give me great support.  I can walk all day with these shoes on - wore them to Hershey park a couple of weeks ago and they were sooooo comfortable.  this is coming from someone who after 2 hrs of walking I limp if I don't have the right shoes on.  please keep making and selling these!!!!\n",
    "Great sunglasses.  They look amazing.  It has a bigger lens so it looks good if your face is a bit wider.\n",
    "I am disappointed.  Buxton has a reputation for high quality, and I owned my last Heiress wallet for nearly 20 months before buying this one.  Gosh what a difference!  This one just isn't what I expected...cheap thin leather, bad stitching of the zipper to the leather that's already coming out, cheap plastic backing (instead of leather) on the checkbook cover that won't allow its removal from the wallet...the only good thing I can say is that I didn't have to pay full price.  I've been a loyal Buxton customer for nearly 30 years.  If this is what Buxton has sunk to, I may not be back.\n",
    "I have a wide foot.  The fact that they were wider when I first tried them on was not an issue.  I have purchased many pairs of Clarks shoes in the past and will continue to do so!\n",

    "Just as expected, fit, color, service\n",

    "wristlet broke after 2 days\n",
    "BEST SHOES EVER and I'm back to get another pair! I have dead to the floor flat feet and got PF in only one foot (go figure). However the PF is now nearly done after several months of wearing these. I've even gotten to the point where I will get up and walk around without them because the pain is sooo relieved. If you have PF, esp newly diagnosed you won't go  wrong with these. I'd had it for a little while - couple of months-- and upon putting these on and taking a step, I was floored I could walk normally again. I almost had to learn to re-walk since I had been limping. PF usually needs a multi treatment approach, but these should be on your list.\n",
    "One of the best cycling glasses I've had so far. And what you get for the price is the best part of it all. Great packaging and fist class group.\n",
    "Very comfortable and they have a wide toe box.\n",
    "I wore a hole in the sole of my first pair, I'm working on the second and purchasing a third!  I cannot live without these shoes!\n",
    "It's a great product.  Does work as expected. I just wish there was a way to put the added plastic pieces further up toward the front of the stretcher, more toward he tip of the shoe.\n",
    "I have owned them for less than a month but they seem to be well made and comfortable to wear. the sun protection is excellent  and the colors are very vivid and at the same time restful on my eyes\n",
    "great glasses for the price\n",
    "The silver coating on the frame pulled off in big flakes just removing the sticky tag on the side.  These are really REALLY cheap sunglasses.  I have seen better in the 5 buck range at grocery stores.\n",

    "My daughter is the envy of all her classmates. They're better than I expected.\n",
    "This are a lot different than the Billfish boat Lite weight shoe. This shoes sole actually lasts.\n",
    "Took two weeks to receive.  Tried them on, and I could feel the red bands that wrap around the arch of the shoe, just standing.  Walked a few steps, and could feel them then, too.  These are neat looking, the mesh is good on them.  But they won't work for Zumba, or for me, just wearing them.  Size fit was perfect.<br />Requested a refund.  If there's a problem with that, I will update.\n",
    "10's are slightly too big, and 9's are slightly too small. I really wish they would have had 9.5.\n",
    "These were fun for my son, but he outgrew them quickly and was rarely able to wear them. They were sturdy and can be worn with or without the wheels, which came in handy.\n",
    "Not worth it\n",

    "We had to exchange for a larger size.\n",

    "I have worn them walking and shopping all day and my feet never have gotten tired.  Great product.\n",
    "This was supposed to be a great deal and the original show fit me like a champ.  The problem is that I was sent a size 6 in mens and not the 9.5 I had ordered.  It is a great shoe and super sticky, with a long climbing life... Problem is that it never got used.\n",
    "Have to return, TOO narrow!\n",

    "Super comfy love them 😍😍😍😍\n",
    "They are ok\n",
    "By far the best shoe I've ever worn! Go 1/2 size up. Provides comfort all day. I'm on my feet for 14 hours a day as a nurse, because we all know 12s don't really exist. You won't be sorry if you buy these!!\n",
    "i have not gotten to wear it yet but when i tried it on it felt comfortable and it worked with the dress. i love that i can use a bra that i already have for this because it saves me money and time shopping for the right undergarment.\n",
    "I think the other review was unfair.  It's clearly listed as a mini satchel and so is SMALLER than your standard dome purse.  I bought it for a friend as a birthday present and she thought it was adorable and uses it primarily for evening.  The leather quality is good and the colors are fun.  I'm considering buying one for myself.  It's a cute bag for casual evening events or when you want to carry a little bit more than a wristlet or clutch would hold.\n",
    "Perfect shoe for the beach not too expensive and did a wonderful job will wear them around the house in the pool highly recommend to anyone looking for a water shoe\n",
    "100% quality!\n",
    "I love Keen's!  These are great, and have a dual purpose.  I use them as water shoes also.\n",
    "The threads on the sides of the shoe are kind of visible which makes me think they are not great quality. As for the size, I am a size 8 usually and that's what I ordered and they fit fine on the width but it is a little snug on the length. I will keep you updated on how long they last.  So after using this product for once a week, for almost 9 months, inside a store (do note that this is not much wear compared to my KEDS which I wear everyday in rain) it already has multiple holes, such a waste of money. I suggest you invest in a good quality sneaker.\n",
    "This is not authentic this purse is a fake don't like wont ever order again disappointed extremely\n",
    "These are awesome! Purchased them for my daughter for school and now they are her go to shoe. She says they are super flexible and comfortable. The price was also great. We would purchase again, in fact I think we may get a second pair.\n",
    "I like but it runs big\n",
    "Very narrow. Too tight. Wish i had returned them but wore them for several hours and have already recycled the box. Not at all satisfied with the fit and this is my usual size.\n",
    "Once you get past the dreaded &#34;break-in&#34; of Rainbows, you will never wear any other shoe again. I live in Hawaii and I've worn these every day for a year and they are in EXCELLENT shape. I love love love my rainbows\n",
    "Cute shoes but they run at least two sizes small. I wear a 9 1/2.  Ordered a 10 and gave them to a friend who wears a 9.  She likes them.\n",
    "Great shoes for working on concrete floors, I would recommend them for that type of work.\n",
    "good fit,helps out ,things stay where I put them\n",
    "KIND OF CHEAP. WISH THEY WERE A BIT MORE STURDY BEING THAT THEY ARE KIDS SUNGLASSES\n",
    "There awesome like walking on pillows\n",
    "Cute shoe. Super lightweight, making it a perfect shoe to walk and stand in for hours. No complaints.\n",
    "I love running in these shoes.\n",
    "Great all round shoes\n",
    "It is hard to get the cards out.  Money is a pain to get in and out of.  Looks cool but is annoying and I bought another one finally to replace it.  Probably good for kids.\n",
    "&#34;Slim&#34; cut style really flatters the foot. Hugs the arch nicely for a pretty point unlike other more bulky shoes. They do run a bit small and because the canvas is lighter weight, they wear out faster.  A thicker leather sole would help turning but it's adequate.\n",
    "wore these on a trip to the zoo.  very comfortable.  I didn't experience my usual low back pain from walking all day.\n",
    "These are heavier than any boots I've ever owned, and they're not even boots. But the arch support is good and they are comfortable. I wear a 10.5 and went up to an 11; they go on easily and the liner prevents discomfort from rubbing. These are good for my purpose, which is to walk my dog in wet fields in the morning. Maybe the heavy weight will help build up my legs.\n",
    "My son loves Merrells.\n",
    "insoles will not stay in. when wet they smell bad.\n",
    "They're PERFECT!!!!\n",
    "Comfortable and handsome.\n",
    "Fine!\n",
    "No confortable at all!!\n",
    "Love the comfort of these shoes.  They are adjustable and fit my medium width foot perfectly\n",
    "I love these sandals. I have 3 pair and I wear them all the time.They are very comfortable. I recommend these.\n",
    "arrived right in time, safe package, they look even more adorable than in the picture, classy elegant  they fit perfectly, I am very happy.\n",
    "I have these in black and white.  Love them.\n",
    "A little small but ended up working!!! Love them!!!\n",
    "seem like good quality, buy they are way smaller than expected. I read other reviews suggesting to order large so I went up a size. I should have gone up at least 2, I couldn't even get my foot in... easy return though in case you get the wrong size initially.\n",
    "I grew up in the city of San Clemente, California, where the Rainbow sandals are made! I have worn them since they opened their doors! There is no other sandals made better and with pride! However I do know they have sourced them out which has been very upsetting to me personally but I do encourage you to own at least three pairs you will not be sorry and as for colors they have them all!\n",
    "I was worried these wouldn't be stylish enough to wear every day.  They are so very comfortable.  I love them.\n",
    "adorable\n",
    "The only reason I bought these is so I can touch the ground on my FJR when I stop. Cheap fix for short legs on a tall motorcycle. They fit fine .<br />Larry\n",
    "I loved these shoes when I got them, cute, comfortable and they fit well. I wore them 2 - 3 times a week. Now I've had them 3 months and the gold color is flaking off all over the top and sides. Definitely NOT the kind of quality product that I expect when I buy Sketchers\n",
    "My feet were so painful I had to walk with a cane. I wore these shoes 4 days and was much improved. I could walk without pain.\n",
    "Nice and comfortable fit. Love them!\n",
    "These shoes didn't work out for me. Fit big on my heel and hurt the top of my foot.\n",
    "Very cute just way small! Sent back for a whole size larger hopefully they'll fit. In all very well made and cost seems to be worth the shoe.\n",
    "as always a good basic shoe\n",
    "Perfect size..not to big.  Roomy inside.\n",
    "very good\n",
    "Love them...excellent price and true to size\n",
    "The boots are cute however they wear too easily.  I bought two pairs and each of them the fabric is already wearing off.  I think these would are more of a fashion type of boot...for show only.\n",
    "1. Looks good<br />2. Comfortable<br />3. Offers about as much protection as my expensive polarized Ray Bans and the Oakley's used for almost a month before returning (can't really tell much difference)<br />I certainly highly recommend these.\n",
    "These are for my Great Granddaughter and she loves them.  She's only 4 years old and this is the best I can tell you.  Thank you\n",
    "These are very stylish for those who have a small head and nose bridge.  I struggle to find sunglasses that fit me and don't make me look bug eyed.  I'm very happy with these.\n",
    "Great for the beach or outdoors.\n",
    "Despite my first size choice being a bit small (I'm literally a 7 3/4, and I never know on what size a shoe is going to fall, and the wrap was comfortable (if slightly snug) at the 7.5 size, but I couldn't fit the &#34;flats&#34; part of the shoe on with the wrap on.  I think the 8's will be perfect!<br />Great for anyone doing yoga, or any usually barefoot dance or exercise that requires a bit more grip.  Could also see the wrap as good beam/floor shoes.\n",
    "Great!!!\n",
    "beautiful mules.  I am accustomed to Frye fitting large so ordered a 7.5 to fit my 8.5 feet.  turned out they are pretty much true to size...maybe just a touch large.\n",
    "The size is too small than other models of polo shoes\n",
    "Great!!!!!!!  Very Comfortable and the fit is excellent!\n",
    "Excellent sneakers and great price.\n",
    "I love these shoes!  They are cute and comfortable.  They are also stable with a non-slip rubber textured sole and a nice wide heel.\n",
    "I have had my purse since Aug 12 and I noticed the strap on one side has come in sewed AND its about to break from the gold piece that holds it together! Very disappointed with it ..still love the purse its just broke ALREADY! Refund!?!???\n",
    "Small and narrow although I ordered a larger size. Insoles would not fit.  Sides of the shoe are too soft;  Pretty show though.\n",
    "Excellent! beautiful\n",
    "Too small. I have 4 pairs of shoes and all of them are 8.5 in size. I ordered a 8.5 thinking it would be nice and it was way too small I am waiting for a refund.\n",
    "Glasses are exactly what I wanted  and very flexible as advertised\n",
    "I use arch support insert. This is third pair of these for me. Please keep making them.\n",
    "Very attractive boot, not too heavy which is a pet-peeve of mine. I am a size 9 to 9.5 and ordered a 10 based on the reviews and because half-sizes are not offered. The 10 is too big (heel goes up and down). But with thick socks it does not rub in a painful way. It has not yet rained here so cant comment on effectiveness. I am 5'8 with skinny calves and the boot does come up to about lower to mid-calf on me and does rub slightly. It is a little annoying but if I werent concentrating on the boots I probably wouldnt notice it.\n",
    "Look great. Arrived quickly.\n",
    "Love these shoes. Everything I was looking for. I liked them so much I bought another pair in a different color.\n",
    "My mom loves these. They are the only sandals that don't hurt her feet. She needs good arch support.\n",
    "I absolutely love this bag! I bought it to wear classes at University and it is perfect. It has much more room than i thought it did and it can hold all of my books and stationary. Lovely purchase!\n",
    "It's just what I wanted except the coin section is pretty hard to get into to get coins out.\n",
    "Love, love, love this bag!\n",
    "I like them, but they aren't the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. The style is awesome, though. Just what I was looking for. Discomfort? - a small price to pay for the fashion.\n",
    "Love love love this purse. Got it quick and rarely ever do I switch to a different one. Lots of storage I even use outside gun pocket for my cell phone. This seller was awesome\n",
    "So far so good... Customer service...fantastic\n",
    "I ware size 9 - so I ordered size 9 1/2 thing they would to small - the opposite happen they were to large - I ordered 2 pairs of size 9 and I love these shoes - very comfortable - true to size - and I might order a third pair\n",
    "Bought them 5 years ago, and still using.They are still in great shape.<br />I do not think I will every buy anything other than crocs as slippers. They are very very very comfortable.\n",
    "The glasses where dark enough and covered my eyes. And they came with a bag so that was nice.\n",
    "My 2nd pair of Maui Jim, and it's just as I expected. The clarity of the lenses is second to none, very light weight frame meaning no mark on either side of the bridge of the nose. The arms are not too loose or too tight right out of the box and most importantly, the fit is perfect!<br /><br />I have a small noggin which often gives me difficulty finding sunglasses that fit nicely. Women's sunglasses tend to be a bit small with short arms and men's tend to be too big. I found a happy medium when I switched to Maui Jims a year ago. I have the Maui Jim Waterways which I love but decided to invest in another pair this time opting for one with nonslip silicone nose pads. I researched for about two weeks before finally deciding to pull the trigger on these Kawikas and man they are exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about getting a pair of Maui Jims, I would highly suggest you just man up and get em. I know that the price is a bit high, but trust me, they are worth it. Aside from the excellent quality, Maui Jim has a great selection to choose from.\n",
    "They run small - because of the waterproof gore-tex lining - so I go up 1/2 size ... and have no problem.<br />I have a wide foot - I was wearing a size 9 1/2 4E in New Balance shoes - but since I have switched to Asics I went up a full size to a 10 1/2 in order to have enough width and I go up another 1/2 size when I buy the gore-tex lining.  They do not rub my heel - and are only slightly longer in the toe area.  I love them !!<br />First of all Asics are wonderful - I walk 5 miles a day/5 days a week.  Next - G-TX is wonderful !!!  .... I work in delivery during summer rain - and winter snow ..... these shoes keep you feet warm in the winter and DRY .... and they are not too hot for summer either.  The only reason I haven't purchased them to wear year round was the price .... .but my other Asics have greatly increased in price, making these about the same price - so I may start buying the G-TX year round. .... they are just harder to find to purchase.<br />They have changed the style since 2014 and this style was a little stiffer - took a little time at home to break them in.  First pair of Asics ever that I had to have break-in time.\n",
    "awesome love them\n",
    "Boots are as described, they wear very comfortable, easy to put on, appear to be well made.\n",
    "Great shoes. Very good price. Perfect for running or just on the go.\n",
    "Perfect fit\n",
    "Super comfortable and lightweight.\n",
    "My daughter loves these shoes. Beautiful bubblegum pink color. Fits like a glove\n",
    "Three little girls are loving them! Great for walking, playing on playground (with heel strap on).\n",
    "These shoes do not have the arch support that the others I have purchased.\n",
    "I think these will fit perfectly after wearing them a few times. Like them!\n",
    "Very good product, Thank you\n",
    "Arrived as expected . Nice sharp looking shoe .\n",
    "I have several pairs on Vionic sandals. These were too large/too wide for a size 9. A friend who wears a size 11 was able to fit into these shoes. Use caution when purchasing.\n",
    "These run a size too big, had to return them and the smaller size was unavailable, very disappointing for someone with a size 15 foot!!!\n",
    "Really like these shoes first time buying and trying FitFlop shoes and I'm glad I did very well made and pretty I'm normally a 9.5 or 10 in size medium width and after reading helpful reviews for sizing I decided to go with a 9 because it was open toed and foot bed length is good. They stay on your feet effortlessly and are really cushioned and comfortable to walk and stand in. I will defintely buy another pair and style very well made don't get frustrated with sizing once you get the size down their a dream to walk in.\n",
    "Beautiful shoe but I wouldn't recommend if u have small calf's..the straps will not fit snug to your legs\n",
    "This was a gift for my daughter. She loves them and wears them all the time. They were less expensive than anywhere and fast shipping. Thank you!\n",
    "beautiful shoes!! ordered a size bigger, like suggested in reviews, love the color, the sparkle and they look great, comfortable.\n",
    "Good heel height for comfortable walking and standing. Broad enough toe box to prevent adverse pressure.\n",
    "Nice looking comfortable shoes! Will definitely buy them again.\n",
    "They are comfortable, I did have a problem, as soon as I worde them the first time one of the straps came out of the silver buckle and I have not been able to put it back in. other than that I like them\n",
    "Great fit as expected\n",
    "Awesome product.<br /><br />I guess it is true that you do not realize a good thing until it is gone.  I am writing this after trying the new Kahana7, which is a disappointment.<br /><br />This shoe feels extremely comfortable.  I have ran in this shoe on trails, tracks, roads and everything in between.  I average about 40miles a week and I believe this shoe has helped me avoid injury.  I love the way it support the heals and ankles.  Please bring this model back asap!!!!!!\n",
    "They are quite comfortable, I would be in them all day buy not bad for several hours. And they are soft on the soles of the feet.\n",
    "I totally love this produce .. saw great results I only two weeks...\n",
    "Nicely made classic Aviators available in several colors. I have this in the Grey frame/Blue lens, and I like it a lot. My better half, who does not usually like Aviators, likes this pair a lot.<br /><br />The blue lens has a reflective mirror quality, a bit more than the Amazon photo indicated. I don't mind it, but it's sort of a California Highway Patrol look, so don't be surprised.<br /><br />Aviators usually have pretty fragile metal frames, and these are no exception. They come with a soft microfiber bag, but no hard case, so if you'll be packing these in a travel bag you'll want some kind of hard case for them.<br /><br />Lightweight. Comfortable to wear. Good visibility through the lenses. They feel good and look good.<br /><br />Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review. These are the only Aviators I own that my Better Half actually likes the looks of. I'm pleased with them.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful as you comparison shop online. Happy shopping, everybody.\n",
    "As other posters mentioned, the shoe runs small. I have NEVER ordered a size 9 shoe, yet I had to return these and exchange them for a larger size, a hassle. I thought New Balance shoes were more uniformly sized, and that was my previous experience. So when I get a chance to wear the size 9's that I had to get in grey/pink, I will leave a better review as my toes hit the tops of these shoes and I had to exchange them!\n",
    "I have purchased two sets of these boots.  I had serious ankle surgery about 4 years ago and cannot wear heels much anymore.  I gave these a shot because I wanted to have something that looked nice and were also comfortable.  They look great with my work clothes (I'm an attorney) and I have gotten several compliments on them.  I'm a little disappointed with my first pair.  The zipper comes disconnected at the bottom of the zipper and I have to occasionally rework that to get it to zip up.  Also, the right heel came loose and clicks a little when I walk.  I bought the second pair and haven't had any issues at all, but I wish there was something that could be done about that darn heel!  I had them less than a year.\n",
    "I bought these for nursing school. I use them for class and lab. I bought a different paid of shoes for when we do our long clinical days, but these are the most comfortable shoes ever! I love them!\n",
    "Nice Shoes!\n",
    "Good\n",
    "love the shoe, wish they had them in black\n",
    "Sent back too small.\n",
    "Great arch support however, these shoes need more cushioning overall in the footbed\n",
    "I love the style of these glasses, however, they distort the real color, they make everything look pink instead of green.\n",
    "These are darling!  The material is much nicer than most wellies/rain boots.  They don't make that obnoxious squish sound when you walk in them, they're warm inside and have a nicer supportive insert.  They're lined with something soft, so the material the boot is made of is not flush against your leg.  My feet also don't sweat in these as they do in most rain boots.  The adjustable buckle is ACTUALLY a buckle that adjusts the width of the boot shaft (rather than just a plastic piece of crap that looks cute but does nothing, as it seems to be on most rain boots).  My feet are slightly wide, though not wide enough to wear a wide shoe and these fit great, even with a thick sock.  I'm an athlete and have very strong calves.  No issues fitting them over, even with leggings or skinny pants.  Love the print too! :)\n",
    "I have worn a lot of running shoes over many, many years! For me, New Balance makes the best shoe. These are very comfortable and look great!\n",
    "I absolutely love love love this purse/wallet.  It is perfect\n",
    "Great! Did not fall in them! Great boot. High and brings out ur calves! Cant wait to get a different color! (got reg boot color)\n",
    "Love them ♥️\n",
    "They fit my daughter perfect and they shipped fast.\n",
    "Awesome shoes!  Just remember you are getting these from China so expect a long delivery time.\n",
    "These shoes were perfect for my trip to Portugal and Spain.  I wore them almost everyday.  The Cobblestones are wicked in Spain but I was not bothered at all with these more stylish than walking shoes.  They gave me enough support and the soles are very sturdy.\n",
    "The sole of both shoes toe came unglued after my third 15+ mile run.\n",
    "They fit and feel great!  Well worth the price\n",
    "Not my most comfortable Vionic shoes. Keeping them but not comfortable enough to wear if doing a lot of walking. The straps over my toes rub. It helped when I tightened the ankle straps. Hopefully they will get better.\n",
    "they are a little bit heavy so that you  hear the steps of your child, but they re comfy for several hours.\n",
    "Lov'em!!! :-)\n",
    "My daughter loves these boots. Cute and comfortable\n",
    "very nice and classy shoes, I like it :))\n",
    "Good\n",
    "muy buen producto\n",
    "Loved them but the 8 was too small - tight @toes & length.  Disappointed that no size 8.5 available to re-order.\n",
    "These shoes look very pretty, but left a blister on the back of my foot the first day of wearing them in the office.  I intended to buy the black color as well when I first received them, but after wearing them I have changed my mind.<br />Size wise they fit true to size, maybe a ted too narrow, but still OK. I wish they were more comfortable.\n",
    "Great shoe. I bought a pair in the past. From another company. Many differnt colors to chose from. Great for walking and running.\n",
    "Awesome shoe!  Very comfortable even w/the height. I am on my feet all day as a teacher & they actually feel good. I even prefer them to a flat. I have a narrow heal, so must wear an insert.\n",
    "All in all a great shoe.  I have bunions so I need wide shoes.  So far Easy Spirit has been the only wide shoe I have found that is actually wide.\n",
    "Great shoe!  I have been wearing them for years!\n",
    "THEY COULD STRENGTHEN THE BOTTOM AND ADD ARCH SUPPORT!\n",
    "I love those shoes. The size I was order is 1 size bigger compare with US size and fit me perfect. Shoes is very elegant, in each shoes lock have a little stone. It's look so beautiful. Bottom of the shoes is have very comfort pad, will help big time if I have to stand or have a long walk. I love it.<br />But my ankle too small to have perfect look in this shoes. I have to use the last hall of shoes halter, then make shoes halter are crooked, and make my ankle look so ugly. But again like I said, that is nothing from the shoes, just because my ankles are too small. So that why I have too bite my toung and return it :( and order one pair similar but no hight halter\n",
    "Great purse with a lot of compartments.\n",
    "Very Pretty\n",
    "Unfortunately they don't come in half sizes. The 7 and 8 both fit as expected, but I really need a 7.5.  No matter, I kept the size 7!  They are super cute, I wear them all the time, and super comfortable.\n",
    "Excellent product . Recommended seller !!\n",
    "They were too big for my face so I returned them however they were nice sunglasses.. Would recommend.\n",
    "Love these sneakers. Have another pair of rosheruns, but these, somehow, are much more comfortable. Highly recommend these!!!!\n",
    "Love these classics! Great shoes for school! Nicer looking than a sneaker but meets all the requirements for sturdy footwear for the playground and gym floors.\n",
    "They are OK for ocassional use\n",
    "good products!\n",
    "Great Boot, Ariat will never let you down!!\n",
    "You can't go wrong with pedipeds!  These look great and fit great and are durable.\n",
    "good product\n",
    "I can't wait to get mine I just ordered black ones! ☺\n",
    "I have been very happy with these boots! As the reviews and info suggested I went up a size and they fit perfect. I've had them for 2 months now and wear daily, anywhere between one-four hours each day. They are starting to crack in some spots from wear, so no longer water proof as I found when I stepped into a river but still perfectly usable for work around our farms and chicken coop. I love the prints and since they are so inexpensive I plan to buy more!\n",
    "Great  pair of shoes my daughter loves them . Thank you for making the purchase as painless as possible.  I'll tell everyone about these shoes.\n",
    "Very cheap looking and poor quality fabric.\n",
    "It's more dressier looking than most Ecco shoes. These will go well with my suits.\n",
    "I love them. I bought them but not sure I would wear them very long. I had them on last night for about 4 hours. That was fine. No problem These are absolutely gorgeous!!!\n",
    "This is only shoes I can ware to walk all day\n",
    "Great\n",
    "So glad I bought these.\n",
    "I bought these years ago not from Amazon but another source.  They used to be wonderful as the first review on here says.  I bought them a second time and now they are as the second reviewer notes.  In other words they are cheaply made foreign junk.  Buyer beware.  Also the picture is deceiving as the heels do not come up over your heels.  They slip off your feet and come apart in a minute.  Garbage.\n",
    "I knew before I bought them that I needed a size smaller than I normally wear in a croc. They are definitely not sized the same.\n",
    "They were the right size and they are evey comfortable.\n",
    "Really good value for the price. The sole is somewhat stiff to me, but thats probably only because I'm used to running shoes with air sole. The leather is pretty thin though, easily wetted by rain. However, the style is great, love the color, and worth the price.\n",
    "Great deal!  It would've been nice to have more men's and not so many ladies.  Awesome price for what you get\n",
    "Good looking, comfortable glasses for tennis.\n",
    "UPDATE: Hiked the Grand Canyon last month and they were perfect!  Great support and comfort.  I suffered from tired legs but my feet didn't hurt at all.  This is a no-brainer purchase.  Do it...<br /><br />Only took one hike so far in these but it was great.  Very supportive and great traction.  I've always been a Timberland fan and these don't disappoint.\n",
    "Based on the comments, I ordered a half a size up and it was perfect (I'm normally US 7.5 - 8 and I ordered a US 8.5).<br />The shoes are very comfortable and they look fantastic.\n",
    "Glasses met expectations - use them for car driving, cycling and general outdoors use\n",
    "Great for wedding after you take off the heels\n",
    "These bedroom shoes are great! .This is the 3rd pair I've purchased, one for me and gifts for others.  The support is so much better than your average bedroom shoes and this is the prettiest shade of light pink!  The price from this seller was terrific and the shipment came through without any issues and before the promised deadline.\n",
    "Original pair ran small, exchanged for larger very expeditiously, good service by supplier\n",
    "Bought this bag at TJMaxx for $10.00. I bought this bag for organization for my large Whipping Post Tote.  Coin purse is big enough to use a wallet for my Dave Ramsey Cash envelope system with come index dividers and I am using a Vera Bradley coin purse. Love that I can have a smaller bag in my tote for when I just need to run into a gas store etc and not have to take my huge tote in!\n",
    "I can see\n",
    "Super  Light!\n",
    "Kind of provides a little arch support.\n",
    "Nice, comfortable.\n",
    "Comfort\n",
    "Everytime I wear these light weight shoes I receive compliments, they are much prettier than the photo.  I ordered the Bronze, they seem to go with everything I wear.  They feel like I am wearing slippers - the soles give grip control that I can walk down a very steep driveway which I did not dare walk even with hiking boots.  I lucked out to get on a lightening sale for $24.99 and really enjoy them.\n",
    "These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  No break-in time required.  Comfortable right out of the box.  Could be on my feet all day with comfort.\n",
    "My son loves this shoe and purchased a second pair because they are so comfortable.\n",
    "Love the shoes.  Very pretty, but also very comfortable.  Goes with shorts, skirts, pretty much anything.\n",
    "The ends of the laces are too thick to fit into one of the pairs of shoes I wanted to lace. Have to use these with a different pair of shoes. I wish 40&#34; were available. These are too long at 45&#34;, but the next length down would have been too short.\n",
    "Very nice color to go with a lot of pastel clothing.  The only caveat I had with this particular slip-on was that the back of the heels needed to be broken in as it was a little stiff at first.\n",
    "These shoes are really comfortable for my wide, flat feet. I spend around 12 to 16 hours on my feet a day, so comfort and support are absolutely necessary. These shoes really deliver. They are not quite as roomy in the toe as my old Brooks shoes. But since Brooks changed their sizing, these have served in their place. I'm taking off one star because for some reason, these shoes squeak like crazy. My patients know when I am coming because they can hear the soles of these shoes squeaking all the way down the hall. I have tried all the tricks I've found online and nothing seems to help. Carpet, linoleum, concrete, or wood... It does not matter. These shoes are loud! I've had them for about five months and worn them at least five days a week since receiving them. It's not the worst thing ever, though. I've learned to deal with it.\n",
    "Beautiful Shoe! Relatively comfortable. Fits well. Foot feels secure in these. While still being sexy. True to size.\n",
    "Has a large capacity for cards is easy to get into. Doesn't take up a lot of room in your purse.\n",
    "I purchased shoes for dual purpose: river crossings and camp shoes for backpacking.  I took liners out to make them lighter.  They are super lightweight and worked great in river and on land.  A bit wide without insert, but I have wide feet so it was no problem.  I like that they can be cinched down for a more snug fit crossing rivers.\n",
    "I ordered these sunglasses because my Ray Ban's just like these got lost. I did not want to pay another $200 so I decided to try these out, and I absolutely love them! So fashionable and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this product to anybody.\n",
    "Love this bag!\n",
    "I have three other pairs of KEEN shoes - one other sandal. This is considerably narrower and ... what? ... shorter? The distance from the bottom of my foot to the top of my foot is sorely squished in these, as is the width of my foot. All my other KEEN shoes and sandals are delightfully comfortable, and are my chosen shoe if I'm going to be on my feet for hours. These almost killed me at a music festival.\n",
    "Good but a little short for the size\n",
    "Super comfortable.  Love these boots!\n",
    "Bought during 50% off. Great deal and quality boat shoe.\n",
    "my granddaughter loved it\n",
    "These shoes run large.  I read the previous reviews and bought it half a size smaller than I normally wear.  They came and were slightly to big but I had bought them to wear to an event that was the next day.  Wore them that evening and they stretched and are now way to big for me.  Its to bad because I really like the shoe and would wear them if they fit.  Buy them small and give yourself the chance to exchange is they don't fit.\n",
    "I wish they made prettier shoes w/ this wonderful support.\n",
    "So cute!!! I loved the color, very girly but won't get dirty quickly. I always swore by brooks for running but these are my new favorite. My second pair. You should buy these!!!\n",
    "I love the look of these shoes and the way they fit.  Was disappointed in the memory foam inside the shoe.  I guess I expected it to be more of the memory foam.  I stand on my feet all day and walk in them.  But I will add some more memory foam.  I ordered a half size bigger than I normally wear, based on the reviews I saw before I ordered.  I like to wear thick fluffy socks in the winter and I think these will allow them.\n",
    "Is good but too large\n",
    "These are great for anyone who struggles to get laces tied or keep them tied.  Easy to install.  Good product.\n",
    "These sandals are perfect for pedicures.  They keep the toes comfortably separated and are sturdy enough to walk in outside.\n",
    "Love them\n",
    "Would have been great but it ran that little bit too small\n",
    "I am returning.\n",
    "I have big feet so the narrow toe box in Nike are not for me.\n",
    "unfortunately this pair had a manufacturing defect and had to be returned which sports hub handled gracefully and a full refund was issued. I purchased the same shoes in the past however and juat loved them!!\n",
    "so pretty . i love my sneakers\n",
    "liked them a lot, and will be buying more.\n",
    "They are more beautiful than in the picture and are very comfortable!\n",
    "These shoes are stylish and comfortable.  A big gold star for Jambu.\n",
    "Great pair of boots.\n",
    "These are wonderfully comfortable shoes, nice modest heel, being 5'9, I need to keep the heel height to a minimum and these don't make feel like a giant:). Very attractive, can be worn with slacks or dresses - winner:). I ordered the black lizard and the navy blue.\n",
    "The band around the top was extremely uncomfortable.  They have already been returned as unwearable.\n",
    "My daughter loves these.\n",
    "Cool concept! Little difficult getting in and out of for me though. Kept it though cuz i do love it\n",
    "Gorgeous purse. My wife loves it. Seems to be well made and looks beautiful, if you like beaded bags.\n",
    "Nice pair of flip flops\n",
    "cool\n",
    "I love these shoes, great for lifting, squats, deadlifts, pretty much anything to do with the barbell.\n",
    "Came a day earlier than stated, which is always nice. Product as expected. Started wearing them right away. They are correct size, etc.  I normally wear a 10 1/2, but noted from another reviewer who wears the same size, to order a 10 and they would fit perfectly. So I did, and they did.\n",
    "Definitely my favorite shoes I've worn. Fits perfectly out of the box and these shoes last for a long time.\n",
    "Fotos fine as long you morder half size larger tan usual...<br />As forma the resto, excellent...\n",
    "I'm between an 8 -9. I needed the 40. 39 just a little small. Best sandal I've ever had!!! So comfortable. Love them\n",
    "Great all around shoe - good for work!  Haven't worn them for long period of time yet so not sure on the all day comfort.  Nicely finished on the inside.  Fit true to size!\n",
    "Bought my first pair of these at a running store and paid twice as much.  So when I needed a new pair I checked in with Amazon, and there they were (with 20% off to boot)!  Comfortable and wears well.  Will probably stick with this line next time I need a running shoe.\n",
    "Great style, nice materials, poor fit.\n",
    "Comfortable and classic.  This is my second pair and I have  found them to be a very comfortable walking shoe. Great for travel.  I have waked all over European cities in them.  The versatile, classic style works well with skirts, slacks, jeans, ----- from farmers markets to the opera.  Light weight for packing is a plus!  I have high arches so I can't say they provide good arch support for me, but they may for others.  My feet are never sore at the end or the day. I will buy them as long as they make them!\n",
    "I bought 2 pair of Hot Chocolate Design shoes in size 6.  These flats are roomy and fairly comfortable.  The heels were tight and too small.  I just love the designs though.\n",
    "Perfect for casual fit!!<br />I love it!!!\n",
    "Most comfortable sandals I've ever wore, and this coming from someone who has sensitive feet.\n",
    "Good shoe for the price\n",
    "Very comfortable shoes\n",
    "No problems with product or vendor.\n",
    "Great pair of boots. Great fit and quality.\n",
    "Was worried bc of the reviews, but these are perfect. Wore them straight out of the box on a hiking trip. Comfortable and fit perfect. I normally wear thick socks to get the roll down effect, but these don't need em. Matches everything and they look FANTASTIC with leggings.\n",
    "I bought these boots for early season hunting as well as hiking. I like the fact that they were Gore-Tex and very lightweight. I wore them on a recent trip to Glacier National Park, where I hiked 35 miles in 2.5 days, and these boots were excellent! I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a breathable, lightweight hiking/hunting boot. The ankle support is excellent as well. The only thing I could possibly gripe about is that these do seem to run a smidge narrow. My feet are somewhat wide, and these still fit great, but were a bit snug. Perhaps that's what you want in a good hiking boot though, as it provides more support.\n",
    "THANK SO MUCH I SUFFER FROM DIABETIC NEUROPATHY AND THIS TYPE OF SHOES WORKS WELL FOR ME. DANNY.\n",
    "Great price for a beautiful boot\n",
    "Actually I wear a size 9M so I should expect them to be too small. With this shoe 9.5 fits the best, even size 9 is not comfortable. I LOVE THESE SHOES THOUGH!!!!! If you can order a half size up, you would have a good fit, probably because of the pointed toes. The shoe is GORGEOUS and the heel height is perfect for wearing with ankle pants and skinny jeans.\n",
    "A little large for my size 10 feet but very comfortable\n",
    "like them\n",
    "Everything ok\n",
    "I've never had a 'tennis shoe' boot before, and LOVE this pair! They provide awesome support, yet are light weight enough that I can wear these all day (and I have) with ZERO straining issues on my knees. They are comfortable, yet rugged. Recommend.  :)\n",
    "Love Clark's sandals.\n",
    "They are great! Good price + really great service!<br />Thank you\n",
    "I like the shoes\n",
    "I've been trying to get ahold of sneaker star for a week now to exchange my shoes for a pair of one's that are a half size bigger. No response. I need an address to send the shoes back so I can exchange them for a half size larger but I can't get an email back.\n",
    "Looks exactly as it does in the picture. Great size and great quality!\n",
    "Great! Fits perfectly. She has narrow feet though. I don't think people with wide feet would find them as comfortable.\n",
    "No more than what I expected. Bottom is a bit mor slippery than I'd like it though. Fast shipping. Worth it.\n",
    "I love these shoes! I got the black leather ones. The size, style, fit, color, and description is exactly what I received! I was intrigued by the low cut above the toes. It is not your usual coverage of the entire toe area: the crevice between big toe and next one peeks out. I think that looks great! The straps above the ankle fit well. I plan on getting another pair in a different color. I am very pleased with these shoes and would highly recommend.\n",
    "Love them I bought my mom a pair to she loves hers\n",
    "Strap shorter than expected\n",
    "Love these Sandals!! I think Jesus, would have loved them too! 😊👍🏽\n",
    "they were perfect!\n",
    "The reading glasses fit just right. They actually look and wear with comfort.\n",
    "Loved this pump, perfect for a formal night out, even prettier in person.\n",
    "love keens - last for kids!\n",
    "Great\n",
    "Two narrow in the foot, to wide in the heal, i just need laces on my shoes.\n",
    "It was my fault.  I didn't read that they were women's boots.  I ordered and of course fit too small.\n",
    "These are my favorite shoes in the world!  Naturalizers seem to fit my wide feet well, and these are so comfortable and give good support.  I need a casual shoe that doesn't look too &quot;clunky&quot;. I don't like pointy toes and I don't like rounded toes that look like a clown's shoe. These are perfect.  I got my first pair fitted at a shoe store, and when I ordered another pair online I was pleased that the fit and quality were the same.\n",
    "Bought sz 3 for my 7.5 yr old, fits great.\n",
    "Didn't fit well.\n",
    "LOVE IT\n",
    "I love the shoe but it was too narrow!  Had to return.\n",
    "Fits as expected and keeps my daughter's feet dry.\n",
    "Do not order these online, as the size is not accurate.\n",
    "I needed more something that had better cushioning and they do not provide it.\n",
    "I have worn mine for the past 4 winters.....I need new ones but sadly it seems they are no longer available.\n",
    "I have narrow feet and I have trouble finding shoes to fit.  Naturalizer used to be the brand I turned to but they don't work anymore.  I was hoping these shoes listed as AA width would fit because I like the design.  But they just don't fit even when I insert innersoles.  I am dissappointed<br />that I have to return them.\n",
    "So small\n",
    "Second pair of Gel-Noosa shoes.  Love them!\n",
    "Love it!\n",
    "My son picked these as his school shoes\n",
    "Absolutely love the look. I am a size 5.5 or 6, and boy am I  glad that I ordered a 6. They are the the correct length, but so narrow that my feet are nearly falling asleep ... I mean they are so tight - and I have normal/ slightly narrow feet! To compensate, I would highly suggest a half size larger than normal (though I don't know how much that would even help... I mean these guys are crazy narrow). My hope and guess is that after a few weeks of wear they'll stretch.\n",
    "Bad quality ans size z really big... :/\n",
    "Item was as described and shipped A S A P.  Great seller!\n",
    "Excellent Quality ...\n",
    "I love this sandals, beautiful and comfortable!\n",
    "Tried to return this shoe was hardest thing.\n",
    "good pair of shoes. my girlfriend loves it\n",
    "Ok\n",
    "i wear them all day on concrete floor standing, with my othropedic inserts\n",
    "Such a great shoe and I got it at a steal. I know NW shoes run narrow, so I went up half a size, but now it's a little too long as they've stretched with wear (nothing that heel grips wont fix) They did scuff easily though\n",
    "The bag came earlier than i expected and so far its pretty great. The quality is nice and i love the style :)\n",
    "As expected but a little large\n",
    "Nice and comphy shoe. Looks good and can be used for light hiking.\n",
    "Fabulous shoe. Even on my first day of wearing, no points where I feel uncomfortable or pain. The strap around the ankle area is very comfortable, giving stability without constraint. I am tempted to order more pairs in case they are ever discontinued. I travel a lot overseas and these are going with me.\n",
    "Great\n",
    "Came apart too easily.\n",
    "I ordered a size 11 US, because I own other Clark's dress shoes. These are way too long! I am returning and ordering a size 10 US to replace them. Otherwise, they look great and are comfortable.\n",
    "As expected.  Good looking shoe.\n",
    "I wear these in my studio during the summer months when it's too hot for boots. The floors are concrete, and these shoes have been comfortable for months. I don't expect them to last longer than a year, but for the price and what I put them through, I am more than happy with this purchase.\n",
    "Nice\n",
    "I just love these things! So easy to put on and put away. light weight. doesn't hurt my nose. I do forget they are on. But, I'm kind of stuck between the 1.5 and 2.0 strengths. I have one of each now and will continue to experiment until I decide which I want. Then I will buy one for each room in the house and one in the car and one in the purse. Then I'll have replaced all the regular readers with something I like. I will get each color too. I was thinking that I would like them to be &#34;shorter&#34; up and down length of the lens. Just a bit. But now with the 1.5 strength, the size seems just right. I'll probably stick with the 1.5 strength for the rest of the ones I buy.\n",
    "LOvE Sanuks. Fit true to size. COMFY!!!\n",
    "Beautiful. Packaged to lay flat, but shapes up so perfectly upon opening package.\n",
    "The shoes is awesome and the size fits very well.\n",
    "The brown polish doesn't hold up to a 5 year old boy\n",
    "The boot is sewen wrong so your foot cannot fit into it!\n",
    "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the product for the price. The pleather is actually very supple and smooth and did not look cheap. Though I wore these all day as a bridesmaid, they were not initially comfortable. The heel is very hard but the addition of some cheap, clear insoles made the shoes much more comfortable.  Also, the flat gold flat fake &#34;clasp&#34; that holds the chain hook hit right on the outside of my ankle bones. That area was slightly bruised the next day after 8+ hours of wear. If you are wearing a long dress with these shoes, prepare for snagging. The clasp/chain snagged on the thule of my dress several times while sitting down thankfully I did not see any tears.<br /><br />Overall, the quality was better than I expected and for the price the shoe lasted me through a wedding and will be worn again for special occasions. Definitely plan to buy a pair of insoles.\n",
    "Barely fitted on my feet.\n",
    "appeared larger than it is; very cute; however  VERY small.\n",
    "Great looking rain boots at a great price.  He hasn't worn them in inclement weather yet, but unless they leak, I'd say they're well worth the money.\n",
    "Love the shoes!!!\n",
    "Excellent gym shoe.  Good with weight lifting, good for cross training.  Excellent arch support.\n",
    "Awesome boots for the price! Quality construction and materials.<br /><br />Great for gardening and rainy outdoor activities. Ample room to tuck pants inside.<br /><br />My only complaint is that size 8 runs a tad larger than expected. If you normally wear 8s, I suggest going down at least 1/2 a size on these.\n",
    "Uncomfortable\n",
    "Love these shoes...so very comfortable, right from the very first step!  It would be lovely if the straps were a bit longer.  I also wish that all colors were the same price.  I really, really wanted these in black but that color was 20+ dollars more then this purple and one other color.  I'll be danged if I was going to pay that much more for the same shoe.  For that I only giving it 4 stars.\n",
    "I had one pair that was too small so I ordered one size up. That helped, but they still rub. They are just too pricey to not be more comfortable.\n",
    "These are awsome sauce!! Very much what I expected and the price amazing.\n",
    "Good support, comfortable, well made, worth the money.  No quibbles..\n",
    "Love the Jambus and the red is so pretty. This is my replacement pair as I have about worn out my last pair. The deal on this pair from Amazon was too good to pass up. They arrived perfectly wrapped. Thank you!!\n",
    "First time since 2012 I've found running shoes that work for me. Only reason I did not give them a &#34;5 star&#34; is based on the color. Their orange/black looks more like fluorescent pink/black.\n",
    "It came very quickly and I absolutely love it! Best product I have purchased off of amazon so far!\n",
    "I received these glasses very quickly!  I love them.  they fit my face and look - received many compliments.<br />just wish they came with a case - oh well!!<br />Tova\n",
    "Perfect\n",
    "Awesome fit and looks great!\n",
    "Love the shoes\n",
    "My son likes this.\n",
    "😊😊\n",
    "Not all that but style was pretty cool, quality wise you get what you pay for.\n",
    "need to order these flip-flops one size larger\n",
    "Ray ban always delivers the best!\n",
    "Love them. I get compliment when I wear them. So cute.\n",
    "The faux leather peels off very easily\n",
    "I used to have a pair like these and was so excited when I saw them. they arrived 2 weeks before they were suppose to, and fit very nicely. They were so comfortable I was able to walk all day in them.\n",
    "I walked around the house with these boots on and the heel doesn't feel as high as it looks. I was surprised, in a good way.\n",
    "Love it\n",
    "I loved him unfortunately they're too small for my big head :)<br />So I have to return them even though I like them\n",
    "They look nice but are very uncomfortable if you have to walk any notable distance. I ran in them for only 500 feet to catch a plane and they tore up my heels to the point that they were bleeding.\n",
    "I travelled with this less than half a dozen times and now the retractable multistage wheel handle has become stuck and unusable.  The time this occurred I was about to pass through airport security to board a flight and had to hammer it in to retract it before I could place it on the x-ray conveyor belt.  The laptop sleeve buried at the bottom is also not a good idea as every time I pass through airport security I have to dig my laptop out from a pile of clothing.\n",
    "Great shoes, not great for walking though. Don't wear if your planning on being on your feet for a long period of time.\n",
    "I ordered the wrong size. I did try them on, and they were extremely comfy. Cute, too.\n",
    "Love my bag! I get lots of compliments on it.\n",
    "GOOD QUALITY , GOOD DELIVERY\n",
    "I have about 250 miles on these shoes and they're holding up O.K. I buy Newtons half a size larger than a Nike and that seems about right.\n",
    "muy buen producto\n",
    "Excellent , comfortable shoe!!!\n",
    "My son wears a size 3.5. I bought these for school (which starts tomorrow), but these are extremely large compared to the stated size. However, they are really nicely made. I plan to order him a smaller size and just keep the bigger ones for later :)\n",
    "I just received my boots today it came a day early and they look just like the picture omg they are so cute perfect fit enough room for when i wear thick socks I love them and i can not wait to wear them\n",
    "Love these shoes bought in 2 different colors!  I didn't expect their to be arch support but if you are looking for that these are not the right show!\n",
    "this is my third pair, i love it very comfortable.  i even wear it on my days off.\n",
    "I LOVE THEM.  I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT A GOOD DEAL I WAS GETTING.  I WEAR THEM ONLY IN THE HOUSE.  YOU, HOWEVER COULD WEAR THEM ANYWHERE.\n",
    "No joke,man,if you know how to use it<br />this stuff will make your leather gear shine.<br />This has been my preferred polish going<br />on forty five years.<br />I've seen reviews by people who freaked out<br />when the polish arrived cracked,off color etc,<br />Never happened to me,but,if it happens to<br />you don't panic and don't start it on fire or<br />you'll vaporize essential oils.<br />Just take off the lid and warm the polish in the<br />the can by sunshine,hair dryer,hot water etc.<br />Remember,warm the can not the polish.\n",
    "The boots were beautiful. The length was perfect. However, the top of the shoe, at the base of the lashes was so tight I could barely stand it. I have a high arch, but I have never had a boot fit so tightly on the top of my foot. Broke my heart to return them.\n",
    "These shoes were very cute, but also very uncomfortable. I could only wear them for maybe an hour and that was after I got get inserts for them.\n",
    "Excellent shoes to wear\n",
    "Fast shipping! Awesome shoes!\n",
    "Very nice shoes\n",
    "Good\n",
    "Very good boost\n",
    "The item does not fit like Havanas you buy from the actual store the straps are big.\n",
    "So far these shoes are great, however, I rarely find shoes with enough arch support for me, these are no exception.\n",
    "This small wallet holds much and is a perfect size to fit in any bag I own. Love it.\n",
    "Wish they were a little wider\n",
    "The shoes started out comfortable.<br /><br />But they are not all meant to wear anywhere near a beach shoes.  I got sand in them and decided to wash them on a light wash in washing machine and the tore up\n",
    "Love, Love, LOVE these boots.  They are def one of my FAVOURITE of all times.  I do body work and wear these for 8-13 hours straight doing massage.  I was shocked that they are so comfortable.  I've had them re-soled twice since the blacks are out of stock.  I bought both colours.  Great buy!!!\n",
    "Love 'em, just love, love, love 'em. So very comfortable and unlike the traditional flops!! Get u a pair or two!!\n",
    "Lightweight shoe\n",
    "Yep, muted fall colors that will go with everything.<br />Yep, feels sturdy with reasonable construction.<br />Yep, medium bag will hold iPad and more.<br />Yep, I think it's unisex.<br /><br />I'll get good use from this bag, taking it with me for appointments where I have to wait (doctors, dentists). I think students will find it handy for holding supplies and a book or two. I carry small purses which will fit in the medium bag.\n",
    "These shoes look great but don't feel that great. The length is as expected but they run narrow. The left show also fits a bit high on my heel and rubs a sore spot.\n",
    "Perfect for dressy wear.\n",
    "The toe box of these shoes turn up like a clowns or a jester shoe... They are being returned, obviously Easy Spirit has seen fit to<br />sell a defective product... These are dangerous.\n",
    "Love them. I just havn't had the chance to really wear them yet.\n",
    "These are from heaven!  They're comfortable and I feel super stylish in them.\n",
    "Comfortable and elegant pair of shoes. I love J.D. Fisk shoes.\n",
    "So comfy and cute. When on, they have a bit of a beatnik look that I really enjoy. They are very comfortable--I'm a teacher so I'm on my feet a lot, and I can wear these all day long. They go with everything and were very affordable\n",
    "I am very excited in regards to the Vera Bradley backpack!  I got it because there are times I have to go to the doctor or on errands with my husband who has Parkinson's and is in a wheelchair.  My purse would constantly slip off the shoulder but now I can put the stuff in the backpack and on my back without the constant slipping I now experience.\n",
    "Item was as described and shipped A S A P. Great seller!<br /><br />These are the coolest most comfy shoes I have ever owned. They are great for walking and standing long periods of time. The mesh material is cool and they are machine washable.\n",
    "I bought them for winter, so haven't worn them yet, but they seem extremely comfortable. Good arch support and a high padded collar which provides good ankle support. They also look good. Think they will be perfect for winter traveling and walking in wet, cold weather. They are also surprisingly lightweight.\n",
    "They're OK, but I had another pair by Jambu that I LOVED and these do not compare.\n",
    "Got these when I made a goal to start running.  They have held up pretty well and are turning out to be a great shoe.\n",
    "Awesome\n",
    "Very comfortable.  Order a half of size larger nd firs perfect.\n",
    "Beautiful and I got many compliments\n",
    "This purse was great until the bottom metal part started cutting through the lining on the bottom inside. It is either the clip holding the seatbelt together or maybe the clip holding the feet on the bottom of the purse. I was told by this company they were going to replace my purse and I sent them my information and then I never heard another word from them.<br />Be careful. I get lots of compliments on this purse from men and women. Too bad it isn't lasting very long.\n",
    "Bought for wife. Light and strappy like a sandal<br />Comfy and supportive like a shoe\n",
    "Great sandle, will buy again!!\n",
    "Beautiful shoes\n",
    "Perfect\n",
    "Well the supra shoes was too small. I'll to pre order another shoes of this to try again. Thank you.\n",
    "The sandals are very very comfortable! I wear a size six and a half and they fit me perfectly so if you are a size 7 I would recommend going up to a size 8 as they would be too small for you otherwise.\n",
    "Great size. Nice design and quality.\n",
    "Beautiful bag! However, I thought I was receiving the one pictured. Would be nice to let people know that they will not receive the one in the photo.\n",
    "My daughter just love them/\n",
    "Good shoe! I am so used to things being narrower than expected, I went to the 4E, which was a little wide for me.<br />Not so wide, i could not wear them, but wider than i'd like if I ran alot.<br />Again not Asics fault, I ordered them.  They seem true to size & are very lightweight.\n",
    "Great running shoes... reqady for the next 400 miles !!\n",
    "Nice sturdy white framed sunglasses. I used them for a stage production and they did the job!\n",
    "I switched from Footjoy golf shoes to these skechers.  They took a few rounds to break in but once they did they are immensely comfortable.  The support is slightly less than my footjoys, but i like to wear my shoes a little loose anyway.  I have played about 40 rounds in them and they are holding up really well.  I use a little vinyl/leather conditioner to ocassionally clean them up.  Love these shoes and would definitely recommend a try for anyone considering them.\n",
    "I returned for credit the wide width was still too narrow. I always fit in a &#34;standard&#34; wide width\n",
    "Love these.  It took forever to find a pair of shoes I liked, but these were perfect!  So happy with these shoes.\n",
    "Compfy.  Durable.  Cute.\n",
    "Love them!\n",
    "Fit was great, unfortunately after on outing they were scratched and the material at the top peeled right off. No longer presentable for school...very disappointed\n",
    "Loved the show. Fearful about zipper quality.\n",
    "I love these. I have wide feet and by the end of the day these can feel a little too narrow, but overall they are really comfortable. I love that they are minimalist shoes because I feel so comfortable and the next best thing to barefoot. I work in an elementary school and I'm either walking a lot or sitting on the floor, these shoes are great for both. I love the grey because it's goes with pretty much everything.\n",
    "Okay and get the job done, but they will last only one season. Cute, comfy and my boys loved them, but the inserts at the bottom on the insoles started falling out after a couple wears and the tie on the back started to fray.\n",
    "Pretty good quality for the price,  but shoes run really narrow!\n",
    "These shoes look great and seem well made. I ordered my normal size as I have owned many pairs of Asics. They're basically the only sneakers I buy. These were much narrower than Asics usually are. They rubbed the side of my foot raw. Unfortunately I had to return.\n",
    "These shoes were way too small. I ordered a size 7 and they may have fit a size 5.\n",
    "soft comfy' in general great\n",
    "This kind fine, no problem\n",
    "Like the retro look & feel of these shoes.  Light and comfortable on my feet.\n",
    "Like the shoes. Haven't really worn them much yet. Will accommodate socks for winter.\n",
    "My daughter loves these shoes--absolutely no complaints!\n",
    "Fit as others I have purchased\n",
    "These are heavy shoes.  My former shoes were Red Wing and quite a lot lighter.<br />Wore these all day the first day with no sore spots.  Does rub a bit on the Achilles, they are higher in the back than I am used to.\n",
    "These are great. I'm a bit of a chuck taylor fanatic but these are much better than chucks. They are more comfortable, in my opinion better looking, better built and more durable than chucks. The tounge is flimsy just like chucks which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on preference. I get tons of compliments on these shoes. I like them alot.\n",
    "Love these shoes, so comfortable and fit perfect!\n",
    "Bought these in size 8C, my feet swell or grew since I turned 60.  First, they are awesome looking, a beautiful shoe.  However they are tight thru the toes and the heels are a solid 3&#34; and a bit higher than I wanted for my bad back.  Did I mention beautiful, I love their look!  I wanted to order them in navy or even red but my first pair were $25, and now they are $40 to $60.  Yikes!  I hope when I wear them over 5 minutes, I can say they are comfy.  The larger diameter heel I hope will make me steady on my feet and help the comfort.  I'll add an additional note if they are more comfortable in the wearing at an event.<br />Striking shoe, I was very amazed.\n",
    "excellent\n",
    "Bought these for my husband who has a super high arch and a wide foot. They fit mostly as expected and he can wear them comfortably . I really like the shoes.<br />I do wish that they would make the z strap for men\n",
    "I really like this sandals, but they don't fit,  a little too small.so I really don't know what to do with it. So I gave it to a homeless person in the Street.\n",
    "Been buying these shoes for years. Fits great and last a long time.\n",
    "Awesome shoe for the little ones!'''"
