The foot bed material feels nice and soft but the entire outer edge of the sandal comes up almost like it's forming a cup so that your toes don't lay flat. Instead they are forced upward in a weird position so that the rest of the foot sloped downward into the cupped part and my foot suctions into it as I walk. It's annoying and weird. The raised edge makes sense on most of the sandal except for the toes. I don't really get it. They should lay flat because it would make the arch support do what it's supposed to do. Also the strap that goes between the toes is very hard and hurts my toes. I expected a little better construction for the original $65 price.

Once sitting and reading at the pool, I no longer noticed this issue.<br /><br />4 Weeks In: Starting to notice some a whole bunch of tiny spec marks out of the front of the lenses. I am not noticing a loss in the quality of my vision but from up close they do not look like they did when I purchase these. I clean these with a cleaning kit from Sun Glass hut (where I purchased my other Oakley's).  I haven't seen this isse with my other sunglasses which i've had for a few months longer.\",\n",

I had researched different ways to lace up shoes to make them feel wider and it worked for a while until my foot would begin to blow out the sides of the shoes.  now insert the Altra One2.  This is the most comfortable running shoe I have ever worn!!!  I have had Asics, Nike, Addidas, Zoot, etc.  This one takes the win easily.  I was previously trading off running in Nike Free 3.0 and the Zoot Ultra Kiawe Race.  I was getting ready to start a marathon training plan for this season and decided I needed a new pair of shoes.  I bought these based on all the other reviews stating how wide the toe box is and the fact they are zero drop!  First pair i bought was a size 10 as that is what I wore in the Nike Free and Zoot Kiawe Race.  The Altras were a little too small, returned for a 10.5.  PERFECT FIT!  I have done multiple long runs in these shoes including speed and tempo work.  Average weekly miles in these shoes is about 30 miles.  They have been great so far!  I will definitely buy another pair of Altras when these give out.',\n",

I thought and hoped I'd found the right shoes here, but I didn't.<br /><br />If you don't have high arches these might be great shoes for you because the support in these 2's is still better than the 5.0's.  However, if you ARE like me and you have high arches, I don't recommend these shoes.  The support is insufficient and you will probably hurt your shins or your feet (depending on how you step).\",\n",

I bought two pairs to rotate every other day so that they don't wear as quickly. I've used boots from 5.11, Magnum, Bates, Thorogood, Danner, Converse, Oakley and Under Armour but for comfort Original SWAT is the winner. Even though they are comfortable after one year of daily use (with rotation) the sole is starting to separate from the boot at the heel on both pairs. I suppose that 6 months is about the average lifespan of most boots where the sole is glued to the boot but I did expect that they would last longer because I rotated both pairs every other day. I had a similar problem with the Original Swat Chase boots after about the same amount of time. I tried the Winx2 boots but they were uncomfortable and not even close to the metro comfort wise. If you are ok with replacing your boots every 6 months then these are great, if not I'd go with a boot that can be re-soled.<br /><br />*** Update 11/26/15 ***<br />Recently the side zipper broke on one of my pairs during my shift rendering the boot useless. The other pair is still functional but one boot has developed a squeak even when walking on non-smooth surfaces.

The funny thing was it fits to me and I am wearing the shoes. Consequently, tt is way smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Besides the size thing, it is comfortable and easy to wear and take off. If you are considering buying this, one thing you need to notice is that the rare part of the shoes is lower than common shoes.<br /><br />I satisfied this purchase but I gave 4 stars because of its small size.\tsentiment score:0.08333333333333333\n",

I always order a second pair before the model changes - just in case the next one is off (happens every few years). Great support for narrow, flat, overprinting feet. I clock at least 15 miles/week walking and even used them for some light hiking recently (although it was a bit rough on them).

Shoes hold a shine well, look good with casual outfits, and will pass as dress shoes. Sizing seems to run true. I don't have any special arch support issues so I can't make a judgement on that attribute. The shoes are SUPER light weight, yet seem to be sturdy. The real test will be to see how long they last.

When they arrived one of the eyelet guard things was broken, which was annoying but not something I cared to complain over.

They are slightly wider than thong sandals but they were not too wide and I think the slightly bigger width adds to the comfort. I normally don't like slide sandals because they fall off my feet but these are made of a special rubber and they kind of stick to your foot so they don't fall off easily. The rubber sole on these feel like those anti fatigue kitchen mats, I think they are much more comfortable than the memory foam sandals nike makes. The only reason I rated these 4 instead of 5 stars was the price. I know the purple/pink color is hard to find but these shoes really shouldn't cost over $30 and the ones I bought were $56 so they were overpriced. You can get the black color for $30 at most stores, however I have only been able to find them in mens sizes. For reference I wear a size 7 in womens but when I ordered the black pair I wore a size 6 in mens (even though the chart said I should get a 5).

            "201\treview: I love the style of these sunglasses, but they are not, as described above, polarized.  They failed every test of polarization.  But if you don't care about this anti-glare technology -- or don't want it since it makes it difficult to look at electronic screens such as GPS devices and cell phones -- then these might be for you.  Even though they have that retro style, they are modern enough to look chic.  They have floating silicone nose pads for comfort; thin gold-tones wire rims on the bottom of the lenses; and a plastic tortoise shell frame top that extends into the arms as well.  These sit comfortably on my face without sliding down my nose.  Besides the lack of polarization, the only thing I'm not wild about is the style of the bridge -- the gold-tone design looks a little cheap, much more so than the rest of the glasses.  For the current price of $20, these are priced right and are a great choice for the style.

I bought them for the arch support, which it has, but there are other things about the sandals that completely negate the whole arch support thing and make them really uncomfortable. The foot bed material feels nice and soft but the entire outer edge of the sandal comes up almost like it's forming a cup so that your toes don't lay flat. Instead they are forced upward in a weird position so that the rest of the foot sloped downward into the cupped part and my foot suctions into it as I walk. It's annoying and weird. The raised edge makes sense on most of the sandal except for the toes. I don't really get it. They should lay flat because it would make the arch support do what it's supposed to do. Also the strap that goes between the toes is very hard and hurts my toes. I expected a little better construction for the original $65 price. I guess $34 seems about right if they were more comfortable. My feet always hurt as it is but these make them feel worse. I really wanted to like them.

I like the pattern of the upper which is a combination of two different textures in two different red tones, very subtle, yet pretty. They would be a great to wear in autumn and winter! You would feel warmed up instantly! I don't normally wear clogs because I thought they were for generations of my mom and beyond, but I started to change my mind after trying these on =) My feet feel phenomenal in them. The insoles are super cushioned. So is the lining of the shoes.<br /><br />For the fit, they run mall (as in narrow and short) for wide feet. I got a pair in 8M/W (width: 3-3/8&#34; to 3.5&#34;, length: 9.5&#34;; I didn't exactly understand what that sizing system meant when it had both M and W in it!); and they fit my wide feet very perfectly. I have wide feet but slender heels; and I usually wear 7.5M in closed-toe shoes and 8M-9M in boots (depending on the brands and designs). The long-vamp design covers most of the upper part of my feet, which makes it a little challenging to put them on. However, my feet do not slip out of these shoes while walking.

My toes naturally spread out to the point where my wife says I could fit another toe in between the ones I have.  I had researched different ways to lace up shoes to make them feel wider and it worked for a while until my foot would begin to blow out the sides of the shoes.  now insert the Altra One2.  This is the most comfortable running shoe I have ever worn!!!  I have had Asics, Nike, Addidas, Zoot, etc.  This one takes the win easily.  I was previously trading off running in Nike Free 3.0 and the Zoot Ultra Kiawe Race.  I was getting ready to start a marathon training plan for this season and decided I needed a new pair of shoes.  I bought these based on all the other reviews stating how wide the toe box is and the fact they are zero drop!  First pair i bought was a size 10 as that is what I wore in the Nike Free and Zoot Kiawe Race.  The Altras were a little too small, returned for a 10.5.  PERFECT FIT!  I have done multiple long runs in these shoes including speed and tempo work.  Average weekly miles in these shoes is about 30 miles.  They have been great so far!  I will definitely buy another pair of Altras when these give out.\tsentiment score:0.23599186307519646\n",

It's lightweight, and the sole is a very dense foam, so it provides some cushion while not feeling flimsy.

The wrist strap is beautiful like the clutch itself, but the shoulder strap is a tiny strip of that leather on a stiff, bulky black canvas or something, totally too casual a look for dressier look.

They are comfortable like sneakers and offer the protection i was looking for as a summer/short ride motorcycle boot.  They have lasted for a little over 2 years where i used to go through otger boots in 1 year.  At the end of their life the leather,  stitching, and tread all wore out at the same time.  Maybe a downside for some but i dont care is the black color fades to green as they age (see pic of 2.5 ywar old boot) I went through 2 pair of laces.  I wish this boot was one of their made in the USA boots.  I would be willing to pay more if it was.\tsentiment score:0.14958333333333335\n",

If buying through Amazon, please know the prices vary among vendors AND prices will vary among the sizes within the same vendor as well.  For instance, occasionally I find that a shoe will be one price for a particular size, but then when I go up a half size, it will be cheaper.  If you love Stride Rite like I do, and you buy them through Amazon, I recommend you shop and compare thoroughly.  My daughter-in-law bought a pair through Amazon Prime and then I found the exact same shoe and size on Amazon Prime, but different vendor, for $11 cheaper.  Luckily the more expensive shoes were easily returnable through Amazon, but it just demonstrates you really need to shop thoroughly.\tsentiment score:0.12384259259259262\n",

I've already logged 100+ miles on these Kayano 22's and so far it's been very durable.  I've also ran in the rain in them and they have pretty good traction.

            "816\treview: I love the Original SWAT Metro boots, they are hands down the most comfortable boots on the market right out of the box. I bought two pairs to rotate every other day so that they don't wear as quickly. I've used boots from 5.11, Magnum, Bates, Thorogood, Danner, Converse, Oakley and Under Armour but for comfort Original SWAT is the winner. Even though they are comfortable after one year of daily use (with rotation) the sole is starting to separate from the boot at the heel on both pairs. I suppose that 6 months is about the average lifespan of most boots where the sole is glued to the boot but I did expect that they would last longer because I rotated both pairs every other day. I had a similar problem with the Original Swat Chase boots after about the same amount of time. I tried the Winx2 boots but they were uncomfortable and not even close to the metro comfort wise. If you are ok with replacing your boots every 6 months then these are great, if not I'd go with a boot that can be re-soled.<br /><br />*** Update 11/26/15 ***<br />Recently the side zipper broke on one of my pairs during my shift rendering the boot useless. The other pair is still functional but one boot has developed a squeak even when walking on non-smooth surfaces. Though I love the comfort of these boots, I won't be purchasing side zip boots anymore and may consider a different brand as replacing boots every 6 months gets old, and expensive.\tsentiment score:0.14260912698412695\n",

The non-fabric upper is appropriate for the medical field.  Overall these shoes work great.  I have high arches and plan to add an arch cookie for when I have to spend many hours on my feet.  My only complaint is that the material listing is misleading: it should not mention the word &#34;leather&#34;, as there is no leather - &#34;man-made&#34; or &#34;synthetic&#34; is all they should specify!

My suggestion to my dad was apply a small dab of wood glue or Gorilla glue to the knot and snug the knot up tight - that should hold it in place.  I've done that before on similar styles of slippers and it's worked fine.  This minor issue is not a problem with this specific L.B. Evans slipper, but rather this style of shoe/slipper so no deduction of stars here.<br /><br />While my dad has only been wearing them for a few days now, he says that they appear to be very well constructed and are very comfortable.  He doesn't wear socks with his house slippers so these fit very well in his normal shoe size and he loves the fleece lining.

            "1046\treview: This is a wonderful shoe.  Fits well (I have very narrow feet), super comfortable and light.  I'm happy to pay the extra for a product that is made in the USA.  So why 2 stars?<br /><br />I have worn this model for several years.  The first ones started to smell like cat urine (the outside of the soles near the heel) after a few months wear.  New Balance replaced the first pair TWICE at no charge, saying a problem with some adhesive caused the shoes to develop an odor similar to cat urine.  This year, they decided they would not replace them since they were way outside warranty.  That is perfectly understandable.  So I bought a new pair in January, 2015.  Seven months later, one shoe started to have that cat urine-like smell again.  It was only on the outside.  So I contacted New Balance again.  Here is their response:<br /><br />&#34;I am sorry you are experiencing an odor issue with your 990 shoes. I understand in the past we mentioned the odor issue is caused by an adhesive in the shoes. I would like to correct what we have told you in the past. After research and testing we have found the adhesive was not the issue in the odor issue. What we have found the odor is from moisture getting trapped in the shoe and the shoe not being able to completely dry out. The odor does take time to develop within the shoe if not completely dried out before the next wearing.<br /><br />The 990 shoe does have a less breathable upper which makes it harder for the shoe to completely dry out before the next wearing vs. shoes that have a mesh upper are able to dry out at a faster rate than the 990 shoes. We have also found the best way to dry out the shoes is to remove the insoles, loosen the laces, and pull the tongue forward. This is the best way to dry out the shoes to help prevent the odor issue.&#34;<br /><br />Thanks, New Balance, for the explanation.  But please ponder this.  One shoe of my current pair (7 months old) has that odd smell on the OUTSIDE of the sole, not the inside.  If it is a moisture issue, why doesn't the inside smell like the outside?  So far that question has not been explained to me by New Balance. And I don't believe I have exceptionally sweaty feet.  Plus, this has not been an issue in any other shoe I own.<br /><br />Again, these shoes are not cheap.  And I will gladly pay for US-made shoes.  And the fit and comfort are exceptional.  But please consider the odor issue when purchasing.\tsentiment score:0.14029505582137164\n",

Several of the lugs ripped off and they look like shoes that have about 200+ miles on them after at most 35 miles, most of the wear was from one hike/run, plus the feet were killing me from the strike toe strike area really not doing much absorption. I can't see why these are rated so high, I wish I could have my money back, total waste... These were a total let down.

            "1159\treview: Newton makes very good shoes for someone looking to improve their running form by making you strike on the midfoot.  I've been running in them for about 3 weeks, and still feel soreness in my calves, but I can also feel those muscles strengthening, and I notice a change in my stride when I run in other shoes as well.  The shoes themselves don't make you faster, but they help you to become a better runner.  I have the Gravity and the Distance.  Ironically, the Gravity is designed for longer distances than the Distance (poor name choice IMO).  The Gravity is a little heavier and made of more cushioned, durable material than the Distance.  I like both.  I'll probably wear the Gravity in an upcoming marathon and use the Distance for track running and 5-10K runs.\tsentiment score:0.1995833333333333\n",

I plan on wearing these for a number of outings, not just once, and they will handle that just fine. I've used other Funtasma boots and they are still going strong after dozens of uses and miles of walking.

The black rim is flexible all around and has this cool, matte feel to it. We also both think it feels incredible on your face. The UV protection is excellent for the lenses and I don't get a weird glare from the sunlight as you do with some cheaper glasses. Definitely also perfect for a sporty look/style.  To Summarize: -Great value for money. The quality all around is excellent. -The style and fit is excellent. -It's lightweight and flexible.

Surprisingly the design of the foot-bed has more cushion than I expected for a fairly flat surface shoe.  They use Ortholite insoles so it's not uncomfortable at all, at least for a few hours of use at a time.  These were designed for powerlifting...not Olympic weightlifting, there is a difference.<br /><br />I have fairly flat feet and noticed most arched supported shoes don't help me in staying 'grounded' to the floor when performing squats, deadlifts or even leg presses.  I bought Asics wrestling shoes to get a more flat feel to my stance and they helped when using them on legs days but they still were 'too' flexible for my taste.  Although, I 'm not sure how these will do during calf exercises due to the stiffness of the soles.  Again, don't expect very much arch support...not the intent of these shoes.<br /><br />These Crossfit Lite TR's covers the best of my needs in a powerlifting shoe.  They fit perfectly...<br />*The best 'grounding' feeling of stability and great heel support<br />*The larger toe box was genius, most tennis type shoes tend to be tight for me<br />*Not a very heavy shoe at all, very comfortable\tsentiment score:0.23658385093167705\n",

The clarity of the lenses is second to none, very light weight frame meaning no mark on either side of the bridge of the nose. The arms are not too loose or too tight right out of the box and most importantly, the fit is perfect!<br /><br />I have a small noggin which often gives me difficulty finding sunglasses that fit nicely. Women's sunglasses tend to be a bit small with short arms and men's tend to be too big. I found a happy medium when I switched to Maui Jims a year ago. I have the Maui Jim Waterways which I love but decided to invest in another pair this time opting for one with nonslip silicone nose pads. I researched for about two weeks before finally deciding to pull the trigger on these Kawikas and man they are exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about getting a pair of Maui Jims, I would highly suggest you just man up and get em.

I don't mind it, but it's sort of a California Highway Patrol look, so don't be surprised.<br /><br />Aviators usually have pretty fragile metal frames, and these are no exception. They come with a soft microfiber bag, but no hard case, so if you'll be packing these in a travel bag you'll want some kind of hard case for them.<br /><br />Lightweight. Comfortable to wear. Good visibility through the lenses. They feel good and look good.<br /><br />Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review.

            "1696\treview: These are darling!  The material is much nicer than most wellies/rain boots.  They don't make that obnoxious squish sound when you walk in them, they're warm inside and have a nicer supportive insert.  They're lined with something soft, so the material the boot is made of is not flush against your leg.  My feet also don't sweat in these as they do in most rain boots.  The adjustable buckle is ACTUALLY a buckle that adjusts the width of the boot shaft (rather than just a plastic piece of crap that looks cute but does nothing, as it seems to be on most rain boots).  My feet are slightly wide, though not wide enough to wear a wide shoe and these fit great, even with a thick sock.  I'm an athlete and have very strong calves.  No issues fitting them over, even with leggings or skinny pants.  Love the print too! :)\tsentiment score:0.26992424242424246\n",

I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a breathable, lightweight hiking/hunting boot. The ankle support is excellent as well. The only thing I could possibly gripe about is that these do seem to run a smidge narrow. My feet are somewhat wide, and these still fit great, but were a bit snug.

The foot bed material feels nice and soft but the entire outer edge of the sandal comes up almost like it's forming a cup so that your toes don't lay flat. Instead they are forced upward in a weird position so that the rest of the foot sloped downward into the cupped part and my foot suctions into it as I walk. It's annoying and weird. The raised edge makes sense on most of the sandal except for the toes. I don't really get it. They should lay flat because it would make the arch support do what it's supposed to do. Also the strap that goes between the toes is very hard and hurts my toes. I expected a little better construction for the original $65 price.

I had researched different ways to lace up shoes to make them feel wider and it worked for a while until my foot would begin to blow out the sides of the shoes.  now insert the Altra One2.  This is the most comfortable running shoe I have ever worn!!!  I have had Asics, Nike, Addidas, Zoot, etc.  This one takes the win easily.  I was previously trading off running in Nike Free 3.0 and the Zoot Ultra Kiawe Race.  I was getting ready to start a marathon training plan for this season and decided I needed a new pair of shoes.  I bought these based on all the other reviews stating how wide the toe box is and the fact they are zero drop!  First pair i bought was a size 10 as that is what I wore in the Nike Free and Zoot Kiawe Race.  The Altras were a little too small, returned for a 10.5.  PERFECT FIT!  I have done multiple long runs in these shoes including speed and tempo work.  Average weekly miles in these shoes is about 30 miles.  They have been great so far!  I will definitely buy another pair of Altras when these give out.',\n",

However, if you ARE like me and you have high arches, I don't recommend these shoes.  The support is insufficient and you will probably hurt your shins or your feet (depending on how you step).\",\n",

I bought two pairs to rotate every other day so that they don't wear as quickly. I've used boots from 5.11, Magnum, Bates, Thorogood, Danner, Converse, Oakley and Under Armour but for comfort Original SWAT is the winner. Even though they are comfortable after one year of daily use (with rotation) the sole is starting to separate from the boot at the heel on both pairs. I suppose that 6 months is about the average lifespan of most boots where the sole is glued to the boot but I did expect that they would last longer because I rotated both pairs every other day. I had a similar problem with the Original Swat Chase boots after about the same amount of time. I tried the Winx2 boots but they were uncomfortable and not even close to the metro comfort wise. If you are ok with replacing your boots every 6 months then these are great, if not I'd go with a boot that can be re-soled.<br /><br />*** Update 11/26/15 ***<br />Recently the side zipper broke on one of my pairs during my shift rendering the boot useless. The other pair is still functional but one boot has developed a squeak even when walking on non-smooth surfaces.
