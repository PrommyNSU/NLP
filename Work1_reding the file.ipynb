      "Do not buy: really didn't start to wear them until May of 2016. Junk, they are falling apart. The outer sole is so thin that although I wear them almost completely in the house on rugs the inner padding is showing through in the heel. My previous pair from the same company lasted 5 years before I threw them out.  I'm sorry I didn't wear them more often when I first got them as I would have returned them immediately\n",
      "provides great cushion as well as archsupport\n",

      "My 13 year old son loved these shoes excellent quality service and on time for his Birthday !!!\n",
      "Ok, I have been searching for shoes to replace the shoes I used to wear but are now too crazy expensive. (wanna guess?) I am so happy with these, I did get them on sale, which helped me a lot, but honestly, these are truly worth more. The\\y are so comfortable, the arch is awesome, the cushioning, which is my number one issue (fat woman, 35 years working intensive care) is amazing. I love that the tongue is super thin and doesn't get in the way. I love the lacing system, but i needed a little more room in the shoe, some days it works great, other days i wish i just had one more inch, lol. Are you looking for an amazing shoe? Cushioning, smooth rocker bottom?? These are them, I couldn't be happier. I also introduced them to another friend who worked ICU with me for many years, she bought them and adores them too!!! (yes they are a little on the narrow side, just be aware)\n",
      "I went a full size down and they fit better but these are kinda wide.  Nonetheless I love them!\n",
      "I would have to say this is boot is very good for my line of work and I buy a pair every year.\n",
      "The size is misleading!\n",
      "These shoes are very comfortable.\n",
      "I love these sandals!\n",
      "Good quality shoes. Great for casual or business attire. Lots of compliments!\n",
      "My daughter really likes those shoes. They are comfortable and fit well.The black started to fade already after only a couple of weeks but they are still good shoes.\n",
      "It's okay .\n",
      "Love these shoes! Perfect fit, very comfortable even walking on concrete floors for 10 hours. They look good, feel sturdy. Excellent product, amazing value.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "I like the go walk3 more than go walk. The textile is too hard.\n",
      "Kids love them for comfort, great price.\n",

      "Cute & comfy\n",
      "Absolutely love!!\n",
      "Very sturdy. A great travel tote - lots of pockets and back pocket unzips at the bottom so you can place the bag over the handle of your suitcase for easy transport. Never travel without it!\n",
      "Comfortable just a little loose on my feet.\n",
      "it is comfortable\n",
      "Everithing was good\n",
      "I love this bag! I saw it at a boutique store for $78 and decided to see if it was on Amazon. Such a great price and it's an awesome, well-made bag w/ oodles of pockets for easy organization. Plus - lovely color!!\n",
      "Nice shoes but a little snug.\n",
      "Nice durability, comfortable and stylish.\n",
      "This pair of Sketchers is now the second pair I've bought, where the left shoe does not fit as well as the right.  The left is slightly loose.  I have the first pair of Go Walk Sketchers I bought, and they fit fine, so I have to assume the fault does not lie with my left foot.  Disappointed, given the price.\n",
      "I have flat feet that are large in width so the 1st few times they were a bit snug & uncomfortable to wear. After those few times they are most comfy casual shoes yet ......the material is made from bamboo so didn't help with the comfort the first few times wearing them either :(\n",
      "The boots are lights ,very confortable but the only thing that I did  not liked was are so tall.\n",
      "Not what I expected would not order again\n",
      "This is my second pair but different color. excellente.\n",
      "Slippers are adorable and so soft on the inside!  Love the rubber sole too.  Very comfortable!  My size is 8 and read from some reviewers that it runs a little larger in size, so I did go with size 6.5-7.5 and it fits wonderfully.\n",
      "It is larger than I anticipated.  I have not used it yet but it is brand new and will work great.\n",
      "Returned for a pair of Asics Cumulus. They were just okay, I ordered too big which was my own fault but I really didn't like the look of them all that much anyway once I got them. Not enough arch support for me, personally. Width was good, I have a wide foot. I'm kind of glad I didn't order the right size because I would have probably kept them. I am so much happier with the Asics I bought instead- I feel like I'm walking on a cloud. These shoes felt a little stiff like cardboard.\n",
      "Arch and ankle support are critical in this type of boot. This boots has that.\n",
      "These boots were order as the 9c which is the wide width when we received them the box and the shoes were marked 9b when we went to return these we were told that they were 9c's and were just mismarked well they were too narrow so we are now returning for refund would not suggest these if you are looking for a wide width.\n",
      "I love these shoes! I got them to wear around town because they look cute and comfortable, and they are. I added some insoles to add extra arch support for long walking days. Overall, excellent boots!\n",
      "I have had great luck with Brooks running shoes. They offer great stability and effectively cushion my feet.\n",
      "Very nice\n",
      "Fits as expected, fast delivery, very pleased.\n",
      "Cheep, made in China although they advertised as made in America, and they were a size too big. They are going back.\n",
      "Love them! I ordered a 1/2 size larger than normal.they fit perfect.great gym shoe.\n",
      "I initially bought an 11 and to exchange for a 12.They're fine now. I usually wear an 11 so I  guess they ran a little small. It could be the style of shoe rather than a dress oxford.\n",
      "Merrell are great boots, fit and feel great. I wear them everyday and on concrete floors. This is my third pair!\n",
      "Love these shoes!  Best hiking shoe i've ever had!\n",
      "Love these sandals!  Cushioning and comfortable yet attractive and easy to put on!\n",
      "To be fair they didn't fit me, which doesn't mean that they don't fit. Brooks makes a great shoe with great arch support.\n",
      "They're a lot darker than pictured. If backlit, you can see the tortoiseshell pattern but otherwise they just look a very dark brown. This was a bit disappointing to me but otherwise they're a good pair of sunglasses, they look well-made and they feel sturdy.\n",
      "love my boston's and now I love these. Finally they made a male flip flop.  Great comfort.\n",
      "Happy with the purchase\n",
      "I love it\n",
      "i do love the  sparkle of this bag,,,after all that was one of the reasons for purchasing it.... HOWEVER.... it is MISSING 2 RHINESTONE STUDS in the same area so the missing studs are quite noticeable! The other reason for the purchase is I like LARGE bags,,,while the size of this bag is okay the opening is small... disappointed in that...but oh well  when ordering online it is always a hit or miss!\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "For my wife and she is super excited to have them for her first trip to Disney!\n",

      "I loooooove this product so so much &#60;3.<br />It makes me look cool like superman\n",
      "I love these shoes.  So comfortable!\n",
      "Really love this style of shoe.  More sturdy than a slip on, but less bulky than a true sneaker. I had a pair in yellow that I got all greasy from biking, so I switched over to black.  They're holding up well, comfortable, and seem like they would survive a run through the washing machine if I wanted to clean them up.  Very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Sweet\n",
      "Excellent shoe, great quality great price.\n",
      "I had to add inserts to the back of my heel because the size 6.5 was too small ad the size 7 was too big.  I have narrow heels.  With the inserts (they stick the the inside back of the shoe) they fit great!\n",
      "Terrific shoe at a reasonable price promptly delivered. Thanks!\n",
      "These boots have the typical timberland comfort.  They are not heavy to wear all day.  I do find that I need to lace them up pretty tight to keep my toes from rubbing the composite protective toe on the boot but all in all they seem like a good boot right from the box.  My rule of thumb is to get 1 year for every $100 I spend.  I would guess that in roughly a year the soles will start cracking which is also typical for timberland boots.  But they are work boots and I do beat them up for that year, and quite honestly they are comfortable.\n",
      "My grandson Sam loved them. He couldn't wait to try them on and show them to his cousins!\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Oakley are always excellent quality glasses. The lenses are a nice strong green color that can't be seen through when worn.\n",
      "perfect fit and you can add another sole for extra comfort\n",
      "These shoes are by far the most comfortable wedges I've ever put on my feet. I HATE wearing heals but I love these shoes! I own them in black as well.\n",
      "I ordered this pair for my mother who has swollen feet and she LOVES these shoes!  She said they're comfortable, she likes the fact she can adjust the strap as needed, and they have fantastic support.  She wears these shoes all day long.  She has raved about them so much that I'm ordering a pair for myself!!\n",
      "I have purchased the sneaker before in the stores in white in a size 81/2. My true closed shoe size is 10.  Based on the reviews I decided to order the 9 and they fit perfect! So, measured your feet ladies and go with those measurements.\n",
      "Not as comfortable as they look\n",
      "It's a nice shoe that gives an outfit a pop of color.  Not a shoe to wear for periods of time if you have problem feet.\n",
      "The only complaint I have about these shoes is they do rub on the back of my heel, giving me a blister but they are extremely comfortable.  I would go up 1/2 size from what you normally wear in them too.\n",
      "I love these shoes. They are the most comfortable shoe I have found. The trouble is that I keep having to replace them every few months because  the soles separate from the shoes. Maybe New Balance could find out what kind of glue the other brands use because I am on my forth and final pair unless the quality control improves.\n",
      "My husband had the same shoes in another color.<br />Every day he had to walk 30min to work, and after work.<br />Very comfortable shoes\n",
      "As described\n",
      "I was actually very impressed with this little bag. I purchased mine in Coffee color. Shipping was fast.<br /><br />Every compartment zips which is nice with keeping things in. The main compartment has son padding witch gives the bag done structure and helps protect an iPad. It holds quite a bit but it's not a huge bag, my iPad mini fits nicely in its case with room to spare. The side pockets are great for an iPhone 5 in a fitted case but an iPhone 6 would be to big but the many othe pockets would work nicely.<br />The strap is soft and comfortable. The zippers are smooth and functional. My only complaint is the lining is a little cheap but it does not bunch up and get in the way.<br /><br />I usually carry Fossil or Vera Bradley bags. I got this for something different and small.\n",
      "Nice boots, purchased for short term protection during floods.  They are a little hot for southern weather, but are perfect to wear to get in and out of cars and buildings during heavy rains.\n",
      "These are super cute!  I wish they had been around when I got married!!  I was worried that it would be hard to see where I was going with the lettering and designs in the way, but it was just fine.  I could see without a problem.  I can't wait to give these to my brother and his soon to be wife at their wedding!  I was able to purchase these at a discount in exchange for my honest review.\n",
      "The purse is very pretty, but the clasp is very hard to open.  I was disappointed with this purse because of this.\n",
      "Very comfortable fits like they should got a great deal thanks to Amazon\n",
      "Before I purchase, I read a review which was about its small size. So, I ordered size 7 even though I usually wear 7.5 or 8. However, size 6 was arrived to my home. The funny thing was it fits to me and I am wearing the shoes. Consequently, tt is way smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Besides the size thing, it is comfortable and easy to wear and take off. If you are considering buying this, one thing you need to notice is that the rare part of the shoes is lower than common shoes.<br /><br />I satisfied this purchase but I gave 4 stars because of its small size.\n",
      "Second pairs of this model Gel-Kayano (#21). Fit as expected (they always run 1/2 size small).  I always order a second pair before the model changes - just in case the next one is off (happens every few years). Great support for narrow, flat, overprinting feet. I clock at least 15 miles/week walking and even used them for some light hiking recently (although it was a bit rough on them). I still have second pair in the box.\n",
      "I am a nurse and on concrete all day;  love the cushion;\n",
      "So far; so good. Bought these as a &#34;one pair does everything&#34; traveling shoe. After the first month of ownership and the first week-long trip I'm really satisfied. Shoes hold a shine well, look good with casual outfits, and will pass as dress shoes. Sizing seems to run true. I don't have any special arch support issues so I can't make a judgement on that attribute. The shoes are SUPER light weight, yet seem to be sturdy. The real test will be to see how long they last. (Hopefully this pair will be much better than the Keens they replaced.)\n",
      "I have bought at least a half a dozen pairs of these over the years. I love them. They mold to your feet and give great support. I wear them all year round. This pair, however, seemed to be a bit larger. My toes are sneaking out over the top edge and they are the same size I always get. I have never had that problem before. Makes me think I need to try shoes on rather than ordering online, even if it is the ones I have bought many times.\n",
      "Attractive style although a little wide.\n",
      "Not sized right.\n",
      "I bought these to wear at work (because I worked in a greenhouse, wet feet was an issue) and they were perfect for that because they were made to be wet, had  some traction, and protected my whole foot. When they arrived one of the eyelet guard things was broken, which was annoying but not something I cared to complain over. However, after less than a month of wearing them they began to rip apart at the seams. Sort of disappointing, I was hoping they would last a bit longer. Maybe I was expecting too much, to hope that a $35 pair of shoes would last for more than a month.\n",
      "Veri nice boots<br />Just to go out nothing special<br />Material should be more better.\n",
      "Just what I expected excellent\n",
      "Love them!! Just what I wanted.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "The strap along the big toes causes pain in the toes.\n",
      "From the toe, uncomfortable\n",
      "Love love love love them\n",
      "So freakin' cute!!! Love these & wearing them in Paris next month ❤️\n",
      "I like these, but not as much as the MT610V2s that these were meant to replace. They are great walking and light hiking shoes. They are sub-par running shoes compared to the MT610V2 versions.\n",
      "Loved the shoe but too small and did not come in my size.\n",
      "Great shoes for racquetball according to my husband for whom I ordered these.\n",
      "ASICS makes an excellent shoe for walking, just as they do for running. This one is incredibly comfortable. I'm on my feet all day, and this shoe is a winner.\n",
      "Bought these for my dad and he loves them!\n",
      "Very nice quality. I have large Oakley sunglasses and it fits them perfectly. Micro fiber bag and cloth are a real plus.\n",
      "I LOVE REEF flops!!!\n",
      "Love Reebok classics! Best fitting and most comfortable shoe. I'm on my feet at least 12 hours a day and my feet always feel great.\n",
      "They are legit and the price is great!\n",
      "Shoes are as great as I had expected from amazon.  Good job, thank you jerry\n",
      "Ouch what is going on in the front of these shoes? They pinched my toes badly.  Too bad they were cute but had to return.\n",
      "These shoes are great.  Very comfortable.  I wear a 5.5 and they are the perfect fit.  I am going to buy more in different colors.\n",
      "I like the style of the shoes. There is zero support though. Keds aren't known as an orthotic shoe so this is not unexpected. The ortholite footbed does almost nothing. The sole is thin so you can feel the unevenness of the ground/ pavement when you are out walking. For this reason, I would never recommend these shoes for walking. To run around to stores or anywhere indoors, they are fine as long as you add your own support inserts. I could not wear them for any extended period of time without my own insert.\n",
      "I'm in love with these! I get comments all the time. Perfect product for the price. Also comes with protective case and cleaning wipe so that is a bonus. If these came in additional colors I would for sure purchase more\n",
      "Ordered a size larger and still to small.\n",
      "Most comfortable kitchen shoes I've ever owned.\n",
      "Sent them back\n",
      "Nice shoe....runs a little small.  I would suggest buying one size bigger.\n",
      "Just cool great fit\n",
      "Good comfortable shoes. Fits nice and are affordable. What else could u ask for.\n",
      "loved it\n",
      "these shoes are are super comfortable!\n",
      "Super!\n",
      "Falling apart after only two times wearing them. Would not buy again.\n",
      "Loved the color and look of the shoes, the width was just fine. But....a few of the reviewers mentioned the shoes were running big.....they're recommendation was to get the shoes 1 size smaller....I did, that's why they were sent back!<br />TOO SMALL!  Doesn't even begin to express how small they were.....!<br /><br /> If anyone else is reading my review, just be aware of their comments, and then, buy the real size of shoes you normally wear.....!\n",
      "Just bought, feel light and very soft but need some time to check durability.\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "The back is too tall and very uncomfortable. I wore them and left my house in the morning and had to return in the afternoon to change them because they had already cut my upper heel. I love this brand but I do not recommend this model.\n",
      "I have 8/12 by 4E which might as well be a square foot or a Hobbits. New balance is the only shoe I can trust to buy online without trying on first.\n",
      "This BackPack is great. Very sturdy. Only thing gripe is the zippers on the front end. Sometimes they get stuck. I hope nothing worse comes of that issue. Either way, great value and i know this will last me at least 2 years or so.\n",
      "Bad this product is ugly , my girlfriend cut me of for this item\n",
      "Have always been a J Renee fan.  Love the shoes\n",
      "Loved how they felt while squatting, very stable and great for allowing me to hit depth. Definitely recommend for people with lack of ankle mobility. My biggest gripe and why it isn't 5 stars is that the shoes are super narrow. I don't have wide feet and these are still tight enough to cause a bit of discomfort towards the end of my lifting session.\n",
      "I'm on my feet all day, and I have tried many different brands of expensive shoes, including Dansko, MBT, Nike air max, Timberland etc. None of those brands are as comfortable as my work Crocs! I love them, and bought several extra pairs  to have as back-ups. They are so comfortable, and they require no break in period. They look good with slacks (business casual) or jeans, and they come in several colors. I have them in three different colors, and use them all regularly. I did have to order a size up, I usually wear a 7 1/2 and had to get the 8, which fits perfectly. The other plus is that they cost a fraction of what I paid for some of these other brands! Love, love, love these shoes!\n",
      "Stretched out the first time I wore them. Could not return, so they were no use to me.\n",
      "I was disappointed in the fit and it is impossible to keep the shoes on my feet when I am walking.  I love Finn shoes- this is my second pair and the styling and quality are very good.  However, with shoes - it is all about fit!  The arch support on these is not nearly as good as my prior pair of Finn.  I love that the straps (both) are adjustable but I still can't keep them on my feet when I am walking.  I really needed a pair of sandals that I could wear to work and make the walk into work comfortably.  These don't work.  I'm basically using them as house shoes to wear around the house.  I apparently need a higher heel or a back strap in order to walk comfortably and keep the shoes on my feet.\n",
      "Comfortable and Stylish but A Little Small. I'd say go one size bigger than your usual shoe.\n",
      "nice light-weight golf shoe - no problem walking 18 holes\n",
      "The main reason I purchased these insoles is to help with my metatarsalagia from running. They are very cushion-y and have allowed me to run with no pain. One drawback is that they are super thick, especially in the arch to heal. I would have preferred to have more cushion for the ball of my foot and less in the arch/heel.<br /><br />That being said, I'm running comfortably again and will be able to complete the half marathon I'm training for, so that's a huge plus!\n",
      "These sneakers provide excellent comfort to my soles! Two thumbs up!\n",
      "Since I got these for $14.99 I have to say I got an incredible bargain and they're very comfortable.\n",
      "Very nice for the price.  As pictured and fast delivery\n",
      "Yeah--I love this bag.  Only gave it a 4--which is somewhat unfair, since these are MY issues and it is described online perfectly:  it's a little (pun unintended) too small.  Also, I like everything about the design EXCEPT a deeper pocket in back would be better & an open pocket in front in addition to the 2 zippered pockets.<br />I had a leather bag exactly as described above.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to find another!\n",
      "super cute, sadly they were not comfortable for me. But I have foot problems and the wedge put just enough pressure on the ball of my foot that I couldn't keep them. They are really nice, I wish I could have kept them.\n",
      "The color was Black instead of Navy. Otherwise everything was as expected.\n",
      "I wish that they were offered in other colors.  I would buy them in all colors offered.\n",
      "I bought these boots about 4 months ago and recently decided to read some of the stuff other people said about them. I want to clear something up that ive read in some comments on the boots. These boots are fairly thick leather and have a long break in period if they hurt your feet thats just how its going to be for a little while the only advice i have to offer people with that problem is bet better insoles and you can ride out the stiffness and then realize these are very well priced. Only complaint is the massive price increase for large sizes i wear a 14 US or aka the 13 UK and paid 150 were someone with like a 9 US paid 80 when I bought them a while back. Notice in the picture all the creases those don't happen overnight so again just ride it out\n",
      "I love them but they were just too small so I gave them to a friend and ordered myself a larger pair.  The faux chinchilla is wonderful.\n",
      "Beatiful shoes!\n",
      "Versatile cross body and will fit more than you think.\n",
      "I lifeguarded throughout the summer and was scared to use my $200 pair of ray bans, I found these on Amazon and they were great for wear and tare purposes. By the end of the three months of wearing them throughout the day they had little scratches but they got the job done. The fact that they are polarized helped a lot. They are very light because they are made out of all plastic but I didn't mind, I knew that by the end of summer I would probably toss them.\n",
      "These are great in an arsenal of basic sneakers. They give a slim profile and are very cozy. The leather/suede upper is a great touch, but does not clean easily. These are a flatfooted shoe, so if you have problems with arch support you should definitely consider alternative footwear for daily out-and-about.<br /><br />Add to this that they are affordable. I wear them regularly Sp/Su/F and get about 2 years of wear which is above par as far as many sneakers go.\n",
      "The shoes fit as expected, and the only reason that I didn't post 5 stars is that they didn't seem to wear very well. What I mean is, after about the thrid time I wore them, on the right shoe, the glue began seperating from the toe. I didn't stub it or anything, and only wore these to the YMCA to excercise, but they just kind of started falling apart. The fifth time I wore them, one of the loops on the heel came off. They were shipped quickly and the packaging was right for the item enclosed.\n",
      "My daughter has 3 pairs.  When I visited her I tried them out and went home and ordered my own.  I love them.  Comfortable, stylish and nothing between the toes!!!\n",
      "I haven't taken these into the water just yet, but wanted to comment on the size for others who are looking. I normally wear a U.S. women's size 7.5 to 8 in shoes. Assuming I would want a snug fit for water shoes I sized down to the 7s in these and they were very loose which would have caused a lot of drag and slipping walking on river beds and such. I received the 6 today and they feel like a perfect fit, snug enough that I am hopeful they'll maintain this comfort when wet. These are shown as women's sizes, but as I wear a 6 in men's athletic shoes, I'd suggest just buying whatever your men's equivalent size would be...<br /><br />I will try to update once I wear these out but so far I'm pleased now that I have found the right fit.\n",
      "Excellent product!  Arrived  on time\n",
      "From my granddaughter's wish list; as far as I know, she loves them and wears them all the time.\n",
      "Very cute shoes, however, they dug into my heels after a couple of hours.\n",
      "These are very cute shoes and are very comfortable for the most part. They run slightly narrow but not too uncomfortably so. The insole is nice and soft and the rest of the shoe is well constructed. The only reason for 4 stars (rather than 5) is that the heel is somewhat abrasive, like many shoes. This is an easy fix with a couple of small band-aids or socks that come up high enough in the back.\n",
      "These are the most comfortable sandals I own and I love the purple/pink color! I usually wear a size 7.5 in nike athletic shoes, since sandals normally run a bit smaller than athletic shoes I ordered a size 7 in women's and they fit perfect. They are slightly wider than thong sandals but they were not too wide and I think the slightly bigger width adds to the comfort. I normally don't like slide sandals because they fall off my feet but these are made of a special rubber and they kind of stick to your foot so they don't fall off easily. The rubber sole on these feel like those anti fatigue kitchen mats, I think they are much more comfortable than the memory foam sandals nike makes. The only reason I rated these 4 instead of 5 stars was the price. I know the purple/pink color is hard to find but these shoes really shouldn't cost over $30 and the ones I bought were $56 so they were overpriced. You can get the black color for $30 at most stores, however I have only been able to find them in mens sizes. For reference I wear a size 7 in womens but when I ordered the black pair I wore a size 6 in mens (even though the chart said I should get a 5). Would I buy these again for $56, probably not, but I really wanted the purple/pink color and they were a splurge. I still love these shoes though and they are exceptionally comfortable, you won't be disapointed!\n",
      "Fit well, great for mowing grass on sunny days.\n",
      "It's a tiny little metal shoe horn. I guess it's cheaper to make these out of metal. I think it's better to get a plastic one, though. There is no reason to make this out of metal. If you're worried about a plastic one snapping then you've got bigger issues.<br /><br />Covered in black paint. The edges seem smooth. Haven't had any problems with jagged edges catching on my socks.\n",
      "Good product... good frame and glass but I didn't like how it looked on me.\n",
      "Well, I have a problem, the item was smaller than expected. I would like to know if there's a way to make a change because they are really small.<br />If you can help me I would really appreciate, my email is japf1492@gmail.com Thank you so much.\n",
      "Shoe as expected\n",
      "Can't find these glasses anywhere anymore.<br /> Love pocket clip\n",
      "Awesome shoe.  I'm getting a lot of compliments on them too.\n",
      "The shoes ran small and the clasp was broken when it arrived. Unfortunately I didn't realize it was broken until I had already worn them. I'm very disappointed.\n",
      "Son asked for these to be ordered to use while in military to train. Shoes held up well and gave good support during ten weeks of training, .\n",
      "I like these shoes and would buy again, but the arch support should be better, hence 4 out of 5\n",
      "Thank you !\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Bought these and once they were delivered put them on immediately.  They are a marvelous pair of Fivefingers! Soft leather gives this pair an understated classic look when compared to normal fivefingers sporty get noticed colors.  I use these for extensive travel. Fit is perfect for average size 12.5 foot size,  quality of materials great, quality of workmanship is there too.  I WISH I DID BUY MORE OF THESE.\n",
      "Very cute, but large on my 14mo. She's in the 50% for height and weight, so average sized baby, but these won't fit her for awhile.\n",
      "The shoes are very comfortable however the sizing, according to my foot doctor, runs a bit small.  She pointed out how close the toes are resting at the very end of the insert.\n",
      "Love these\n",
      "I love these shoes but I got the wrong size\n",
      "These fit as expected and are great for any kiddo with a wide foot!\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Initially they were pretty tight, second time I wore them they seemed to have stretched out, so much so that I am concerned after repeated wearing they would become way to big. Also, after wearing them for over an hour in the house, my feet began to sweat quite a bit. As much as I like them, the style and color and I really like Merrell shoes, I'm afraid I am going to return them because of the sweaty feet and fear of after complete break in I would walk right out of them.\n",
      "There is always the stigma of purchasing shoes online that they will never fit perfectly. Well luckily enough I was able to try these shoes on at the store and get the correct fit that I liked. They came in 3 days above schedule and did what shoes do . Only wish I got them in a different color\n",
      "Nice shoes, comfortable!\n",
      "Beautiful and incredibly comfortable! Wore the for over 16 hours on a very busy day with lots of walking involved and my feet were not hurting at all by the end of the day.\n",
      "super cute! love!\n",
      "The first time I put them on the zipper broke. Until now I couldn't remember where I bought them.  A total loss of my money.  No more Jessica Simpson for me!!  Thank you for nothing  Nancy Ffrench  Yes it is Ffrench with a double f\n",
      "Daughter very pleased with these boots.  Seem well made.  Nice rugged bottoms.\n",
      "High end tri-fold wallet, with bill compartment, coin pouch, many card slots and a window pocket. This stylishly designed wallet is perfect for any one.  This luxury wallet is made of genuine cow leather and the quality is great.\n",
      "These were for my 11 year old 'princess'.  She LOVES anything with sparkles & heels!!  So these were a huge hit with her.  She wears them EVERYWHERE and has had adults wish they could get them in their size!\n",
      "Super cute and comfy. Until they have now failed. With a huge open crack in them where the foot bends. Right shoe now useless. I am so disappointed that I can not return for refund. Vendor should take the hit on these, not me. They did not even last the full season I bought them for.\n",
      "I uv it\n",
      "First of all I order the shoe in black. All identifications (labeling on box) indicated that the box contained the correct shoe. Unfortunately, upon opening the box I found a navy blue/white mixed shoe. Once over my anger, I tried the shoes on, they were very comfortable. I wear them all day and my feet does not burn or hurt. I have ordered another pair, hopefully they will be black as I requested.\n",
      "Love these shoes. They're very comfortable and they are extremely breathable which is important when you're trying to stay cool in the hot summer months.\n",
      "I want to send them back.\n",
      "Size is perfect and Amazon maintain the delivery schedule.\n",
      "I love these shoes! They are exactly as they appear in the picture and are comfortable! I normally wear an 8.5 and ordered that size but they run a tad large. They will be perfect in the fall/winter with thick socks. I was happy with them and was impressed at how fast I received them after placing my order.\n",
      "Easy Spirit is my go-to sneaker. They had discontinued the style I preferred but these are a perfect replacement. I have a heel spur and trouble with foot cramps with most shoes but these are comfortable and do not cause me a bit of problem. Relatively inexpensive for a sneaker but I'll be buying another set soon because they are perfect for me.\n",
      "The shoes fit great and are really comfortable!\n",
      "just great.\n",
